<h2>DEDICATION</h2>

<p class="dedication">TO OUR DEAR MOTHER, THE HOLY CHURCH<br />
THIS LITTLE WORK IS DEDICATED<br />
BY ONE OF HER FAITHFUL DAUGHTERS<br />
WITH THE HOPE THAT HER HUMBLE SERVICE<br />
MAY BE ACCEPTED<br />
<span class="gothic">‘To the Glory of God’</span></p>

<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>Miss Hands reminds me that it was at my
suggestion, as Editor of ‘The Treasury,’
that she undertook the writing of the articles
which form the basis of this volume. My
confidence in her fitness to write such papers
was more than justified by the result. A
mere man, indeed, cannot presume to offer
an opinion of a book on Embroidery which
will carry much weight; yet the letters received
by me during the serial appearance of
these papers showed unmistakably that they
were supplying a real want. In their new
and revised form they cannot fail to be yet
more widely useful. Moreover, the beautiful
work executed by Miss Hands for my own
and other churches is ample proof that she
is as skilled in the practice as in the theory
of her art.</p>

<p>So with much willingness I contribute
these few words of introduction. There
must be many ladies to whom such a book
as this—lucid, compact, and inexpensive—will
be most welcome, enabling them to use
their needles for the highest of purposes—the
service of the Church and the beautifying
of the Sanctuary. We all feel, I think, that
such work, when fashioned by the hands of
worshippers, has a worth and a significance,
apart from its intrinsic value, which no
ready-made article purchased from the
‘Church Furniture’ shop can possess. It
is the concrete embodiment of love, self-denial,
and reverence. It brings before our
eyes an example of human talent consecrated
to the highest ends. And it continues a
tradition characteristic of the Christian
Church throughout its history—one dating
back, indeed, to those more ancient days
when, in the language of the Book of
Exodus, ‘All the women that were wise-hearted
did spin with their hands, and
brought that which they had spun, both of
blue, and of purple, and of scarlet and of
fine linen,’ for use and adornment in the
Tabernacle of God.</p>

<h1>CHURCH NEEDLEWORK</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">INTRODUCTORY</span></h2>

<p>This little book (founded on a series of
articles on Church Embroidery written for
the ‘Treasury’) is intended for the use of
those who are desirous of learning by
practical experiment how to make the best
use of such time and skill as they have at
their command; and who, while they are
unable to go through the long courses of
instruction which are generally indispensable
to the attainment of perfection, are yet
anxious to devote their ‘labour of love’ to
the service of the Church.</p>

<p>There are many Guilds and Associations
of such workers rising up all over the
country who are ready and willing to be
taught, and it is with the hope of assisting
these efforts that I am offering the result of
many years of study and practical experience.</p>

<p>It is quite beyond the scope of such a
manual as this to go into the History of
embroidery in general, or even of this
particular branch of it. On this point therefore
I will say no more than that it is an
undoubted fact that from the thirteenth to
the fifteenth century English embroidery
took a leading place throughout the whole
of Christendom, and that from the fifteenth
century onward embroidery began to decline
as an art till it might almost be reckoned
as lost to England until the middle of the
nineteenth.</p>

<p>With these few facts in view it is not
difficult to determine where to look for the
best examples of Church embroidery. It
must be among Museums, Picture galleries,
and Collections of art treasures of the best
periods that one must study to improve the
taste and cultivate the intelligent perception
of the best ways of doing things, not so
much by actual imitation (although that
might prove an education in itself!) as by
absorbing the spirit of the work and seeing
<i>how</i> and <i>why</i> it was done.</p>

<p>I cannot too strongly recommend this
method of learning, and it is to this end I
have used, wherever possible, such examples
as are to be found in our Churches, Public
Museums, and Libraries rather than those in
the possession of individual collectors.</p>

<p>Embroidery may be defined in a general
way as an ornamentation of textiles by
means of the needle.</p>

<p>This being the case, one ought to expect
from it something <i>different</i> from what can
be attained by weaving, or something which
cannot be done so well or so readily by that
means.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest forms of embroidery
were, it is evident, direct copies of woven
patterns, but these were quite appropriately
placed, either on material which did not lend
itself happily to being woven into patterns,
or where the surface so decorated was too
small to be worth while weaving; or again,
where the ornamental material (such as gold
and silk) was too precious to be lost on the
under-side of the work, as would be the case
in all woven work wherever the ‘ground’
shows between the patterns.</p>

<p>The <i>superiority</i> we expect to see in needlework
as compared with woven decoration
consists chiefly in three points:—</p>

<p>1. The more harmonious gradation of
colour.</p>

<p>2. The absence of mechanical repetition
of pattern.</p>

<p>3. Freedom of line in the drawing.</p>

<p>It is this very freedom from mechanical
restraint in all these three respects of colour,
design, and treatment which has proved
such a pit-fall to the unartistic English
needlewoman.</p>

<p>Much of the beauty of the foreign peasant
work is due to the <i>restrictions</i> imposed by
their traditional style and limited range of
colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>There is practically no limit to the number
of shades available in the present day, and
without a cultivated ‘colour-sense’ an embroiderer
can run riot among an <i>embarras
de richesse</i> with most disastrous results!</p>

<p>A good colour-scheme is even more
necessary in embroidery design than in any
other (except, perhaps, stained glass) because
of the brilliance of its possibilities—at once
its highest merit and its greatest danger.</p>

<p>The colour-scheme, then, being an
essential part of the design, must be decided
upon in accordance with it; and the actual
materials with which the work is to be
carried out should be chosen all at the same
time if possible.</p>

<p>It is necessary for the designer of Church
needlework to have a very clear idea of the
capabilities and the limitations both of the
methods and the materials by which the
design is to be completed as a work of art,
and also a fair knowledge of the traditions
of ecclesiastical art from early times up to
the present day.</p>

<p>It is equally necessary for the embroiderer
to be able to enter into the ideas and intentions
of the designer. It adds considerably
to the interest of the work when it is carried
out by the person who designed it, but I
must protest against the notion gaining
ground largely in certain educational circles,
that the embroiderer <i>ought</i> to design her own
work. There are very many women capable
of executing perfect stitchery and of entering
into the highest ideals of beauty and devotion
who are not fitted by nature or training to
artistic design. The designer for ecclesiastical
art may be compared to the
composer of sacred oratorios—he needs
the co-operation of many minds, hearts, and
hands to perfect the realisation of his idea,
and the many count it a joy to be led by
him. The more entire the sympathy throughout,
the more perfect will be the result. And
they will consider their time and labour well-spent
in practising for this. Even so the
embroiderer with patient stitches will endeavour
to express the ideal set before her
by a master of the craft and will meet with
a like reward. This is the utmost that the
majority of us can hope to attain, and I
cannot insist too strongly upon the statement
that it is better to work from the designs of
good artists, and to do again and again
what has been proved excellent, than to
attempt an originality which may be attractive
only by its novelty.</p>

<p>Whether the worker be her own designer
or not, too much care and attention can
hardly be bestowed on the choice and
arrangement of the design. The principal
requirements to be fulfilled are Beauty,
Fitness, and Practicability.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beauty</span> comes first as it is simply the
<i>raison d’être</i> of embroidery. If decoration
does not really add to the artistic value of
the thing it is applied to, it is <i>worse</i> than
useless as it destroys a certain real kind of
beauty which exists in simplicity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fitness</span> comes next, as it almost amounts
to an axiom that without fitness a thing
which is beautiful in one place may be quite
ridiculous or improper in another.</p>

<p>And <span class="smcap">Practicability</span> is essential because
it is in vain to draw a beautiful design which
cannot be carried out by the needle and
thread. In embroidery the finished work
ought always to be <i>more</i>, not <i>less</i>, beautiful
than the coloured drawing.</p>

<p>Then there is the <i>position</i> it is to occupy—the
style of architecture, method of lighting
and amount of light, size of the church,
&amp;c. A large church and a dark chancel,
for instance, require bolder design and
brighter colour than would be suitable for
a small church or one so lighted that every
detail is evident at a glance.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">ON MATERIALS, ETC.</span></h2>

<p>After the design, or rather in conjunction
with it, comes the choice of the materials
with which to carry it out. The only point
one can insist on is this—let them be the best
we can offer. The best does not necessarily
mean the most expensive—but the most
genuine and the most suitable. Whether of
gold or silk or linen, let there be no pretence
about it.</p>

<p>If silk <span class="smcapuc">DAMASK</span> is chosen for the ground
of the work (and there is nothing pleasanter
to work on, or more satisfactory as a background
if the design of the damask be broad
and flat-looking), let it be a good rich damask
without any suspicion of cotton about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satin</span> is too shiny and too difficult to
keep from puckering to make a really
artistic background for large pieces of embroidery,
although a great deal of the old
work was done on it. It also has this disadvantage
for the beginner, that it shows
every mark of the needle if she is unfortunate
enough to make a mistake which requires
unpicking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plain corded silk</span> is trying to the eyes
to work upon, and is rather hard-looking
and unsympathetic, but it makes a good
appliqué on satin, velvet, or damask.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Velvet</span>, on account of its richness and
the depth of colour attainable without giving
the impression of ‘blackness,’ also from its
strength of contrast with every other
material, has always been in great favour,
whether as a ground or as an onlay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brocade</span> is too assertive to make a good
background, but brocade, and even tapestry
(where the design is suitable) may be outlined
with gold or cord, or further enriched
with embroidery with a truly glorious effect,
when judiciously managed.</p>

<p>Fine <span class="smcapuc">WOOLLEN CLOTH</span>, stout serge, and
diagonal cloth are respectable materials for
inexpensive work.</p>

<p>Yarn-dyed or other good <span class="smcapuc">COLOURED LINEN</span>
and <span class="smcapuc">UNBLEACHED TWILLED LINEN</span> are particularly
suitable for use in the colonies and for
poor churches at home. Both texture and
colouring can be obtained in great perfection,
and when worked in pure flax threads,
which are also made in many degrees of
thickness and almost as much variety of
shade and colour as embroidery silks, they
will defy the ravages of white ants abroad
and the poisonous air of slums at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cloths of gold</span> and of silver are truly
splendid, whether as a background for embroidery
or to be used alone or for orphreys
on a plainer material. Only the very best
kinds should ever be employed for Church
work, any thing else will look tawdry, and
even the best is apt to tarnish in the air of
towns or near the sea. Needless to say, it
is always expensive.</p>

<p>In all the specimens of ancient church
embroideries which have come down to us,
we find a free use of gold and silver threads:
some are worked entirely in gold, others
with a preponderance of the precious metals
used in conjunction with silk, while a third
use was to touch up salient points or as an
outline to glorify the whole and bring it into
unity.</p>

<p>The principal kinds of gold and silver
thread now in use are:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Passing</span>, which is made of flat strips of
gold or silver twisted tightly over pure silk;
a firm, hard thread is the result, resembling
wire, which can be obtained in various thicknesses,
generally sold on reels. This is
sewn down, almost always two threads at a
time, with fine, strong sewing-silk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tambour</span>, much the same as Passing,
only finer, for sewing <i>through</i> the material.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bullion</span>, of various sizes and patterns,
is made of fine wire, evenly twisted in a
spiral form without any silk core; usually
sold by weight. It is sewn on by first
cutting into the lengths required and then
‘threading,’ like the beads called ‘bugles,’
with a fine needle and silk well waxed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Purl</span> is somewhat similar, but coarser,
and without a hollow centre. It is sewn
down by passing the sewing-silk over the
Purl and drawing it down between the twists
of the wire. It is used more for outlines of
silk-work than for filling spaces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plate</span> is a flat wire, used chiefly in
heraldic embroidery. It is laid over raised
thread or string, with a stitch on each side
of the thread, over which it is turned backwards
and forwards till the thread is covered.
In working Bullion, Purl, and Plate, the silk
they are sewn with does not come into evidence
at all. Strong fine thread is even
better to sew them with than silk; both
should be waxed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Japanese gold</span> is the one most commonly
used at present. It is made something like
Passing, only a very thin paper is used
instead of metal to carry the gold over the
silk. Its chief virtue is that it does not
tarnish like most of the Passing. It is also
less expensive, and made in a greater variety
of sizes. Its chief drawback is that where
there is much <i>wear</i> the gold rubs off in the
course of time, leaving only the red or
yellow silk it was wound on as the evidence
of there having once been gold there. The
Passing, on the other hand, wears any
length of time, and, if made of pure gold,
would be as untarnishable as the Japanese,
the excessive costliness being the reason it
is so seldom used. Most of the Passing is
made of silver or other metal, gilded with
pure gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chinese gold</span> is very similar to Japanese,
the chief difference being that the paper
used is thinner and cut in narrower strips.
It is therefore softer, and can be made in
thinner threads than any other. It is more
easily damaged than the Japanese.</p>

<p>Passing, Japanese, and Chinese gold and
silver are sewn down (generally by two
threads together) with a fine twisted sewing-silk;
the colour of the silk used affects considerably
the colour of the gold-work, red
producing a fine coppery glow; green, blue,
and violet ‘cooling’ the gold; and yellow
or gold-colour merely intensifying, or hardly
modifying it at all.</p>

<p>Some of the old work was done in solid
gold or silver wire. Strips of parchment
were sometimes laid over with gold-leaf and
twisted upon silk, like the Japanese and
Chinese do with their paper. Small metal
plates, spangles of various shapes and sizes,
were and are still used with good effect
when in moderation.</p>

<p>The silks employed are chiefly <span class="smcap">Floss</span>.
French floss or ‘stout’ floss, being rather
thick and very smooth and bright, is useful
for large, bold work; ‘Bobbin,’ ‘Church,’
or fine floss for finer work. Decca silk,
which has a loose twist, may easily be split,
and is useful for the brilliance of some of
the dyes, different from any other to be met
with in European makes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Purse-silk</span> is often used, couched, in
place of gold or silver, being easily managed
and wearing well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Filoselle</span> is chiefly useful for edging
appliqué and for outlines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Filofloss</span> answers the same purpose,
and is brighter in texture. It can also be
used for fine embroidery by taking the
threads separately; but the slight twist in
each thread makes it less desirable for such
work than the bobbin floss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scissors</span> should be strong and sharp,
cutting accurately at the points.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thimbles</span>, of gold, silver, or ivory, are
at their best when worn smooth. They
should be as plain as possible, as decoration
is apt to catch and roughen the delicate
silks. New thimbles may be improved by
rubbing down with the finest glass-paper
or a burnisher. The indentations should be
large. In framework both hands are used
and two thimbles required.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Needles</span> should be procured from the
best makers only, as cheap ones are apt to
cut and roughen the silk by friction through
the eye in the course of the work. If for
any reason it may be worth while to improve
a needle which has this defect, it can
be done by the simple process of threading
the eye with strong cotton (as coarse as it
will conveniently carry), dipping it into
olive oil, then into fine emery powder, and
working it backwards and forwards until
it ceases to roughen.</p>

<p>Round-eyed and ‘egg-eyed’ sewing-needles,
crewel and embroidery, large-sized
chenille, and occasionally a curved (so-called
‘circular’) needle, are required.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pins</span> should be fine and as sharp as
needles. Very nice little pins may be made
from fine needles by warming the eye and
sticking a little sealing-wax on it for a
knob; but beware of <i>leaving</i> steel pins in
any part of the work, as they rust very
quickly and make an ‘iron-mould’ stain.
Indeed, it is safer to use pins for temporary
fastenings only, and to put in a few stitches
wherever required for more than a day or
two; brass ones leave a green mark and
silver-plated ones black, while even gold-plating
soon wears off.</p>

<p>A small instrument called a piercer is
sometimes used to keep gold laid in its
place, but a rug-needle, or the eye of the
chenille needle, will do as well.</p>

<p>A good stiletto, a pair of compasses, a
T-square and a set-square, a ruler, measure,
and tracer conclude the list of implements
necessary to the Church embroiderer besides
the frame.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of <span class="smcapuc">EMBROIDERY-FRAME</span>
which have been invented from time
to time to save trouble or to stretch more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
evenly than the ones in general use, but the
two still most commonly to be met with
are the old flat-bar and screw-bar frames.
The former can be rested on trestles when
large, or supported on the edge of a table
and kept in place with weights when small;
those with screw sides are generally mounted
upon stands of their own. For work not
exceeding 30 inches square I find the screw-frame
the most convenient; it can be adjusted
to any angle, so that the worker has
no need to bend over it, being able to see
her work without effort, both as a whole and
in detail. To sit for many hours at a frame
which lies horizontal is apt to injure the
spine (whenever there is the least feeling of
over-strain the work should be discontinued).
It is, moreover, bad for the eyes, forcing
the vision into an unnatural focus. The
small screw-frame on a stand can be clamped
to a table or held in the lap, and is almost
equally comfortable to work at.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tambour-frames</span> and rigid wire-frames
may be used for very small pieces of work.</p>

<p>The light should always fall upon the
work from behind, over either shoulder of
the person.</p>

<p>Due attention to these points (<i>i.e.</i> a
comfortable position and proper light) would
prevent much of the weariness and actual
injury to the physique for which Church
embroidery is often considered responsible;
not always, I regretfully admit, without
some foundation in fact. Still, the majority
of these cases have their own carelessness
to accuse, considering these restrictions to
be mere details which may be safely ignored
instead of taking the trouble to form a habit
of doing everything in the best possible
way.</p>

<span class="smaller">ON MOUNTING FRAMES AND TRACING DESIGNS</span></h2>

<p>A great deal of Church embroidery is done,
for convenience in working, on linen, in
small frames, and afterwards cut out and
transferred to the richer material, silk, velvet,
cloth-of-gold, or whatever it may be. Great
care should be exercised in the choice of the
linen, which should be unbleached and closely
and evenly woven, coarse or fine, according
to the nature of the work to be done on it.
The inexperienced would do well to buy their
linen not from drapers, but from the best
embroidery shops, stating for what purpose
they require it, whether for heavy gold-work,
fine floss, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="400" height="325" alt="Embroidery frame" />
</div>

<p>To stretch the linen on to the frame, cut
the linen, ‘by the thread,’ rather wider than
the webbing which is attached to two bars
of the frame. Turn down the edges evenly.
Run a piece of string into the two sides that
are going to be laced upon the other two
bars. The linen should now be a little
narrower than the length of the webbing, to
which length it is now stretched by a pin at
each end and one in the middle. Over-sew
the linen to the webbing firmly with strong
linen thread; remove the pins; roll up till
the linen is a little shorter than the side bars.
Insert the ends of these into the holes provided,
and stretch evenly either by pegs, or,
in the case of screw-frames, by screwing up
the wooden screw-nuts (which ought to have
been previously placed as near the central
blocks as they would go). Lace up the
sides of the linen tightly and evenly, with
good string, fastening each end firmly. The
linen is now ready to receive the design, or,
if the work is to be done upon silk or velvet,
that is put on now, over the linen. Loosen
the frame a little, either by unscrewing a
turn or two, or by moving pegs. Pin each
corner of the silk on to the linen, stretching
the silk a very little tighter than the linen;
sew all round with fine, strong silk,
or thread, and tighten up the frame
again after it is on.</p>

<p>The design must be well within
the size of the mounted linen.</p>

<p>Two straight lines, crossing each
other at right angles in the centre,
should next be run into the linen
with fine silk, right across from
end to end, as a guide for tracing.
Similar lines should be drawn lightly
on the tracing; both sets of lines
and angles must be accurate; they
are easily done by means of a ‘set-square.’</p>

<p><i>Transferring.</i> There are many
ways of transferring a design to the
material it is to be worked upon.
The easiest and <i>least</i> satisfactory is
by means of ‘ironing off’ transfers.
This limits one to the stock patterns, often
of very inferior artistic value, which can be
bought at the shops. The process gives a
smooth even line, rather thick, which must
be allowed for in choosing the design, as it
must be well covered in the working. It
is only suitable for fairly simple and bold
designs.</p>

<p>The easiest method by which <i>original</i>
designs can be transferred is by the use of
carbon paper. The blue is the most satisfactory,
the paper of which is thin and blue
on both sides, but of course it does not show
up well on a dark ground. Before using,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
when new, it should be laid flat on a table,
and rubbed all over with a piece of coarse
flannel. There is also a fine green and a
yellow, either of which is better for very
delicately coloured ground. Black should
never be used, and I have not hitherto met
with a really satisfactory white carbon paper
at all.</p>

<p>The design should be accurately traced
on good tracing-cloth, especial care being
taken with all geometrical forms, which
should always be drawn with mathematical
precision; the slightest inaccuracy generally
seems to reappear at ‘compound interest.’
It is a good plan when practicable to leave
any large circles that may form part of the
design untraced till after the greater part of
the embroidery is done, and in any case to
test them with compasses. Having then a
perfect drawing to start with, see that the
centre fits to centre and rectangular lines
correspond with the same lines on the frame,
and pin it carefully in place with fine steel
pins. Place a piece of carbon paper between
the tracing and the material in the frame, and
then go over all the lines of the tracing firmly
and clearly with a well sharpened H.B. pencil
or an onyx tracer. A porcupine quill or a
good knitting-needle will make a very fair
substitute for the onyx. The worker must
bear in mind that pressure upon any part of
the surface which has carbon paper underneath
will leave a mark upon the material,
and therefore should be careful not to rest
the hand upon it or make false lines or pin-marks.
A hand-rest can easily be arranged,
if one be found necessary, by placing a block
of wood or a few books on the table on each
side of the frame and laying a board on the
top. It is also important that the underneath
part of the linen in the frame should
be in immediate contact with some hard,
smooth surface, such as plate-glass or a
hard polished board, before beginning to
trace the design.</p>

<p>Another method of transferring designs
is the time-honoured one of pouncing. The
drawing should be on tough paper or parchment.
Pin-holes are pricked all along the
lines of the drawing at pretty close intervals;
a thin sheet of cork or hard felt laid under
the parchment prevents creasing or cracking.
The principal lines may be pricked with a
larger pin than the small details. When
the pattern is sufficiently pricked out it is
pinned to the material, and coloured chalk
in fine powder dabbed through the pinholes.
The drawing must then be very carefully
removed, and the dotted lines which result
from the pouncing gone over with a fine
sable brush with Chinese white, or any good
water-colour, mixed with a little pure gum-arabic
and a trace of ox-gall.</p>

<p>Another way is to trace the design in ink
upon leno or tarlatan, and, after pinning it in
place as before, go over the lines with a
strong quill or ruling pen, using Chinese
white or water-colours as before; this also
gives only a dotted line, but is quite sufficient
for coarse work, and is the best method I
am acquainted with for tracing on thick
woollen material.</p>

<p>Yet another method suitable for delicate
material and not too complicated design is
to take an extra tracing of the pattern on
<i>thin paper</i>, and after tacking the edges of the
paper down to the silk on the frame, <i>stitch
round the outline</i> of the design with fine
sewing silk of any colour that will show up
on the ground. When all is thus marked
out, tear away the paper, leaving the stitches
upon the silk.</p>

<span class="smaller">ON GOLD-WORK</span></h2>

<p>We will now proceed to describe some
of the most useful stitches and how to do
them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="650" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The Sampler</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps it will be best to begin with a
Gold Sampler. Some of the richest and
most beautiful examples, both ancient and
modern, have been worked entirely in gold;
and it is encouraging to the beginner not to
have the complications
of colours and various
silks, &amp;c., to contend
with at the same time,
as it leaves the mind
free to concentrate itself
on the attainment
of a good technique,
which in embroidery,
like everything else
worthy to be called
art, cannot be accomplished
without a good
deal of practice. A
brilliant effect with bad
workmanship is not a
thing impossible, but
in work intended for
the decoration of the
Sanctuary it is even
more to be deplored
than in more mundane
things; though
embroidery of all sorts
not being a <i>necessary</i>
work, there is no excuse
for doing badly in any circumstances.
It is a mistake to think that time and
material spent on practice are wasted. If
our first attempts were looked upon as
scales and exercises, as a means to an end,
they would not be so grudgingly performed
as they too often are.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sampler</span> I have prepared is intended
to illustrate both the stitches themselves and
also the method of applying them to the
forms they are to fill. It is best to practise
them first on simpler forms, and then, when
more expert, to fit them into the various
curves and spaces.</p>

<p>The sampler should be drawn much
larger than it is here represented—say about
10 × 7½ inches—and might be placed on the
linen in the frame as sketched, leaving a
good space below and at the side for practice.
If the frame is 20 inches long, or
larger still, it will hold this sampler and
the next one. It is a good thing to have a
nice set of samplers to keep, as one often
finds it necessary to be reminded of suitable
stitches, which will not always come to mind
when wanted. They can be made up into
a blotter, book-cover, or work-bag, &amp;c., when
finished.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption">The Frame, with Sampler, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>Simple <span class="smcap">Couching</span> (<i>A</i> in the illustration) is
worked thus:</p>

<p>Loosen a yard or two of gold thread out
of the skein and bend it in the middle.
Have ready an ordinary needle, threaded
with gold sewing-silk (the kind sold in large
skeins by weight is the best), and with it
sew the doubled end firmly down; draw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
needle down to the under side, and bring it
up again about a quarter of an inch from the
beginning; lay the two threads of gold
evenly along, and put a stitch at right
angles with the gold over <i>both</i> the threads
together. This is repeated to the end of the
row. At the end each thread is sewn separately
in place and turned sharply back, then
stitched at regular intervals as before, only
each stitch must be placed between the ones
formerly done. If the space to be filled is
not very long, it is usual to take only one
thread to start with, instead of doubling it
into two, and, after drawing the end of the
gold through to the ‘wrong’ side of the
work, fasten it firmly, and begin at the
other end of the row each time. This method
has the advantage of making a less clumsy
turning, and therefore a better edge to the
work, as there is only one thread to double
back every time instead of two. Also, the
gold is more easily made to lie smoothly,
as the stitches cross it constantly from
the same side and in the direction in
which the gold is twisted—from left to
right when beginning from the right at
the bottom, as in <i>a a</i>; from right to left
when begun at the top left as in <i>A</i>. Gold
and silver are nearly always sewn down two
threads at a time (the beginning and end
only being drawn through the material and
sewn down at the back of the work), and
unless otherwise directed it will be so understood
throughout. In a great deal of
modern gold work the gold thread is cut off
close at the end of each row, and the cut
edge afterwards covered by two threads
being sewn all round it. I do not recommend
this plan myself, as I have too often
seen it in after-years with the ends visible
in a very undesirable manner. It is true
it makes a more even outline, but, if done
well, the turned edges can be covered evenly
and without difficulty when required; and
often the slightly serrated edge itself is
beautiful and characteristic, as for instance
in <i>o o</i> and <i>i</i>, illustrated below. When very
fine gold thread is used it may be drawn
through to the back at each end of a row
(without being cut off) and the turning done
there. The way this is accomplished is by
bringing the needle up from the back, crossing
the gold thread over with the sewing-silk
and sending the needle down again
<i>through the exact spot</i> it came out at. The
gold being held rather loose and the silk
pulled tight, it will carry it down through
the stuff just below the surface—the needle
employed should be rather thicker than for
sewing. In the sampler all the edges are
covered with two or three threads sewn
down closely over them, but in the detailed
examples I have left them bare to show the
working better.</p>

<p>The gold thread must not be allowed to
get untwisted so as to show the inner core
of silk; and it should lie quite smoothly,
having almost the appearance of wire, the
silk stitches being drawn tightly enough to
keep it steady, but not so as to make indentations
and destroy the smooth evenness of
the surface. If it wants stroking into
position, a little instrument called a piercer
is used, but the large chenille needle used
for drawing the ends of the gold through
the linen will answer very well, or a good
stiletto.</p>

<p>It will be seen, as soon as a few rows
are done, that the silk stitches make a sort
of little brick pattern on the gold. This
effect is made use of by the ingenious
embroidress to produce many a beautiful
and fanciful diaper. The patterns may be
varied to almost any extent by means of
different intervals regularly left between the
stitches. Here are a few examples: <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>,
and <i>D</i> on the sampler. The middle of the
pine is filled with a diaper like <i>b</i>, and the two
upper halves of the leaves marked <i>D</i> can be
filled with <i>c</i> or <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>It is desirable to work them with
different coloured silks, such as red, green,
yellow, &amp;c., in rather strong shades, that
the full effect of the diaper may appear,
thus also will be demonstrated the very
remarkable effect of the different sewing
silks upon the metal already alluded to
above. No. 98 (and others on the same
screen) in the V. and A. Museum, South
Kensington, may be referred to as specimens
of the amount of colour that may be obtained
in this manner. Some of the metallic threads
are also twisted over with fine coloured silks
to intensify this effect.</p>

<p><i>E</i>, <i>F</i>, <i>G</i>, and <i>O</i> on the sampler are to
show the effect of direction in the lines of
the gold—an important principle, which will
be further illustrated, in the case of silk work,
by the direction of the stitches. Difference
of <i>tone</i> is got by the <i>colour</i> of silk with
which the gold is sewn down; an apparent
difference of <i>relief</i> by the <i>direction</i> in which
it lies.</p>

<p>In <i>E</i> a single thread is drawn through
the linen (about half an inch is enough to
take through and fasten at the back) in the
centre of each petal (see <i>e</i>), and turned
round to make as nearly a circle as possible,
the gold thread laid round this centre twice
and sewn down, two threads at a time, till
the outline is reached. It will be evident,
after a few rounds are done, that if the
stitches are placed in exact alternation they
will be getting so far apart as to fail in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
keeping the gold in place. To obviate this,
as soon as they are nearly twice as far apart
as the average distance, <i>two</i> stitches must be
put between each, instead of one.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 625px;">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="625" height="700" alt="Sampler" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p><i>F f</i> is just taken backwards and forwards
as at <i>A a</i>.</p>

<p>The effect of <i>G g</i> is obtained by placing
the stitches at every round a little to one
side of the previous ones, instead of exactly
between them.</p>

<p><i>H</i> on the sampler is shown at <i>h</i> above.
The gold thread is begun at the base of one
of the petals, and from thence taken straight
up to the top and worked over, putting one
stitch in the centre of each row and taking
the thread backwards and forwards till the
bottom of the petal is reached, when it is
taken up to the top of the next petal and
left to lie under the work as before. It is
best to keep it to the same side of each
petal, or to place the central stitch between
the two threads of gold, as it raises the gold
slightly, and when done with method it looks
intentional. It is convenient because there
is less cutting off and beginning again. At
the edges of the petal the gold may be
turned at the back of the work in the manner
described on <a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a> above.</p>

<p>This slight raising of the gold, as it
were by accident or for convenience, brings
us to the consideration of raised work, and
the question of how far high relief in
embroidery is desirable. This being essentially
a practical treatise, I cannot now enter
into the arguments for and against its use,
but may just remark that relief, however
slight, accentuates the ‘value’ of the gold,
as it draws extra light upon its already
brilliant surface, causing at the same time
extra shadows, and thus adds to the richness
of the general effect, while it takes away
something of its delicacy. The designer
must decide how and when it is required.</p>

<p>The slightly raised foliation in the sampler,
marked <i>I</i>, is done by tacking down
parchment or yellow cloth, cut carefully
about the sixteenth of an inch within the
lines of the tracing, and then working the
gold thread over it (in the same manner as
at <i>H</i>) with one row of stitching only, to
catch it down in the middle. See <i>i</i>.</p>

<p><i>N</i> is raised to the highest degree permissible
by sewing down bits of string (cut
well within the size), first with fine silk, and
then working over them, to get a smooth
surface, with stuffing cotton, and lastly,
covering all with yellow cloth before couching
the gold. <i>n</i> shows the process for working
the raised round; other shapes are done
the same way. There are various methods
of padding for high relief. Cotton-wool is
used by some, and cork, &amp;c., by others. I
find the one I have described the most satisfactory,
as it can be made quite firm and
in high relief without being so hard and
‘unsympathetic’ as the more mechanical
methods. The padding should <i>always</i> be
<i>smaller</i> than the finished work is intended
to be. It should be done as nicely and
smoothly as though it were not going to
be covered over afterwards. The last layer
of stitches worked in the ‘stuffing cotton’
should be done in the opposite direction to
that in which the gold is to be laid (see <i>n2</i>,
where the cotton is shown nearly half done,
<i>n1</i> being the finished gold work).</p>

<p><i>J</i> is one of the most popular of gold
stitches. It is shown at <i>j</i> in straight lines,
and should be well practised thus before
attempting to apply it to curved ones. Rows
of string are sewn down at regular intervals
till the space is covered which is to be filled
with basket-work. Note that in a curved
figure the strings must be placed nearer
together on the inner line than on the outer.
The gold is then couched down over the
string, being sewn with strong silk, which
will keep it down, between every two bars
of string. The next row is done the same.
The two rows following have their silk
stitches placed between the former ones.
The next two are like the first, and so on
till the space is filled.</p>

<p><i>K</i> is a little more complicated. The first
two rows have three bars of string covered
at a time; then two and one alternately for
one row; then three again.</p>

<p>A great many variations of this can be
made simply by covering more or fewer bars
at a time, or, again, by sewing down more
or fewer rows of gold at the same intervals.
The principle of the basket-work is the same
in all.</p>

<p>The stem in the sampler, marked <i>L</i>, and
the ornament at the bottom are worked over
string sewn diagonally over the space to be
covered, as may be seen at <i>l</i>. The stitches
made in sewing down the gold go in steps,
<i>not</i> diagonally, but at right angles, as in
all the others, one stitch on each side of
the bar. The gold may be laid in single
threads.</p>

<p><i>Q</i> is prepared by sewing small square
pieces of yellow cloth or parchment in
chequers over the ground, and then covering
with the gold, sewing down the latter
rather closely with silk stitches in the spaces
left, and putting no stitches on the raised
part. Any shape may be placed under gold
in this way. In much of the medieval work
architectural surroundings and backgrounds
to figures were very elaborately executed,
with the same gold threads used in the
drapery of the figures themselves, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
carried straight across in horizontal lines
over string, &amp;c., and sewn down very closely
with different colours.</p>

<p>The raised veins in the leaves (<i>P</i> in the
sampler) are done with ‘plate.’ String is
laid down first, cut to a sharp point, and
sewn over with stuffing cotton, worked
diagonally or with several strands of it laid
smoothly over the string and kept in place
with a few stitches of fine silk. The plate
is begun at the top, with a stitch to keep
it firm, and then with one at each side it is
turned backwards and forwards till it is
finished.</p>

<p>The little bars across the stems are of
bullion, sewn on with strong waxed silk or
thread.</p>

<p class="caption">Sampler</p>
</div>

<p>Although the foregoing chapter was devoted
exclusively to the description and illustration
of the stitches most generally used in gold-work,
most of them can with equal propriety
be worked in silk. But the reverse does not
hold good: there are many stitches useful
for silk and thread, &amp;c., which cannot well
be worked with gold, because the needle and
thread are taken right <i>through</i> the material,
from the upper to the under side and up
again, in and out, all the time; whereas
nearly all gold-work is done on the surface,
the beginning and end only of the gold being
taken through the material. It is true that
in some of the old embroidery, flat strips of
metal were sometimes worked through the
stuff, also thin solid wire, and the fine
tambour is still used in the same way; but
it is not practicable to any extent with
Japanese gold, or passing; while purl and
bullion, being in the form of a hollow coil,
are obviously unsuitable for being drawn
through the surface as thread. It would
also involve an unnecessary waste of gold to
take it through the stuff and leave it behind
each stitch.</p>

<p>The accompanying sampler does not include
any of the stitches shown in the former
one, except couching. Although, in principle
and in method of working, couching is the
same, whether it be carried out in silk or in
gold, yet, the effect being very different, it
seems desirable to repeat it here. It is introduced
also for the purpose of pointing out
clearly the difference between it and another
stitch which in some circumstances looks
very similar, but is worked in quite another
way and is called ‘Laid-work.’</p>

<p>In both couching and laid-work the
principal threads lie on the surface and are
sewn down with auxiliary stitches by means
of a separate needle and thread. In couching,
these stitches are planted at short
intervals, all along the line, on each row
of threads, while they are being placed; but
in laid-work the whole surface is covered
first, and the few stitches required to keep
the mass of silk in place are added afterwards.
Couching is generally worked in
solid heavy threads, such as gold and silver,
purse-silk, cord and filoselle, while laid-work
is only suitable for floss, its chief merit being
the perfection with which it shows the bright
sheen of that beautiful silk. It is light and
soft in effect and a very expeditious means
of covering a large surface. It does not
wear very well unless caught down at frequent
intervals with the couching or other
over-stitching, as in the example (<a href="#Page_63">p. 63</a>) of
a chalice-veil at South Kensington, where all
the foliage is done in laid-work, the ‘laid’
stitches going <i>across</i> the leaves and the
couching following the curves, indicating
simple veining.</p>

<p>Both laid and couched work, when used
as a filling, are best adapted to decidedly
conventional designs, laid-work especially to
broad and flat effects, and couching to
outlines.</p>

<p>Although shading and even an appearance
of modelling to a slight degree may
be legitimately obtained by the placing of
different shades of silk side by side and by
the direction of the underlying and over-stitching
silks, still it is not well to attempt
too much in this direction, as there are
many other stitches more suitable; and
stitches, like other things, are much more
beautiful when in their natural and proper
place than when forced into a position for
which they are unfit.</p>

<p>This sampler is intended to be worked
in coloured silks. I will mention them
by their numbers on Pearsall’s colour-card
No. II., as it can be bought or referred to at
any ordinary needlework shop, and therefore
seems the most practicable means of explaining
about shades, &amp;c., to those who
have never used floss silk before. While
to others I would say it is certainly not
necessary to use these particular colours, or
this particular make of floss, so long as
the silk is good, the colours harmonising
with each other, and being sufficiently distinct
in shade to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>Three shades of blue, Nos. 41, 42, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
43; four shades of a bronze-green, Nos.
112, 113, 113<span class="smcapuc">A</span>, 113<span class="smcapuc">B</span>; three shades of a
greyer green, Nos. 113<span class="smcapuc">A</span>, 134, 135; a soft
reddish-brown, No. 105, and one of gold-colour,
No. 92, are suggested for this sampler.</p>

<p>Linen thread may be used instead of
silk, on a coloured or a white linen ground,
for practice, but it is necessary for the embroidress
to get used to working in floss<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
from the first, because it is always needed
for the best and richest work, and it requires
a great deal of practice before it can be
dexterously handled. Ornamental rings,
bracelets, &amp;c., should not be worn when
working with floss silk, particular attention
must be given to keep the hands in good
condition, clean and smooth; it is a good
plan, if they are apt to get rough, to rub in
one or two drops of pure glycerine after
washing in hot water <i>before</i> drying them.
The hands should then be rubbed perfectly dry
with a linen towel. If, on the other hand, they
are at all inclined to be moist, they should
be frequently washed in water as hot as it
can be borne, then dipped into cold water,
rubbed dry, and lastly dusted over with
boracic powder. Carbolic, sulphur, arsenical
or other ‘complexion’ soaps should never
be used before working with either gold or
silver or very delicate silks; indeed, it is
safest to use none but pure vegetable soaps
as free from chemicals as possible. A fine
white-linen apron with a bib and sleeves, or
an ‘overall,’ should always be worn, and the
work kept covered with a soft silk or linen
handkerchief. Too much care cannot be
taken with floss silk, as it is apt to catch in
everything it comes near and is very easily
damaged. For the same reason the needlefuls
should not be long, and if the silk be
bought in skeins it should be carefully wound
at once, on smooth reels or cards, keeping a
separate one for each shade, which should be
duly named and numbered.</p>

<p>Of all the stitches which are worked with
silk, I think <span class="smcapuc">SATIN-STITCH</span>, with its many offshoots
and variations, is the foremost both
for usefulness and beauty. The smooth
brightness of the surface; the clean-cut
outline it makes of itself, when nicely done,
requiring nothing further to finish it off; the
ease with which shades and colours melt
and blend in soft gradations or bold effects,
make it <i>the</i> stitch <i>par excellence</i> for floss-silk
work, whether coarse or fine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus7.jpg" width="400" height="190" alt="Diagram A, 1 2 3" />
</div>

<p>The Flower marked <i>A</i> on the sampler
is worked thus:—</p>

<p>Take a needleful of the palest of the three
shades of blue floss and run round the traced
outline of the upper portion of one of the
petals. Never begin with a knot, but run a
few stitches into a part that will be covered
afterwards; to fasten it firmly just take a
back-stitch and do not cut off the end till
you have worked a few more stitches;
always begin and end a needleful on the
‘right side’ of the work so as to have no
loose ends at the back. Then bring the
needle up from behind to the surface near
the centre of the petal; set it in just over
the outline at the top; draw it down with
one hand and set it in with the other. (It
ought to become, by practice, a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
indifference which hand is at any time above
and which below.) The next stitch must be
shorter, the next longer, and so on till the
edge of the petal is reached. The other half
of the petal is filled in the same way,
beginning from the middle, and keeping the
ends of the stitches even along the top and
quite irregular along the bottom of the row.
The stitches should be just so close together
as to make a firm clear edge without either
overcrowding or thin weak places.</p>

<p>The next row is done with the middle
shade of blue; after fastening the end of
the thread, take the needle through to the
back, then bring it up between the two long
middle stitches and about halfway from the
top, set it in again to make a stitch about
the same length as the others were, and
continue working in the same way; the only
difference between the first row and the
second being that the second is worked from
the upper part downwards and that both
ends of the stitches are irregular in length
instead of only the lower ends. Also there
will be fewer stitches in each row as they
get nearer the bottom.</p>

<p>The number of rows required will depend
on the size of the petal, so will the actual
length of the stitches. To give some idea
of the proportion, I will suppose this petal
to be an inch and a half in length and an
inch and a half in width at the widest part;
the stitches would then be from a half to
three-quarters of an inch long at the longest;
it would take four rows of stitches, and
there would be about thirty of them in the
top row of the petal when using the full
thickness of Pearsall’s ‘Stout Floss.’ The
central stitches should all be vertical, and all
the others radiating—that is, slanting outwards,
towards the edge of the petal; this
direction of the stitches must be very carefully
managed, not to be too sudden in
change, and the rows of stitches should
‘dovetail,’ as it were, into each other. In
this example two rows of the middle shade
are used, and only one each of the lightest
and darkest.</p>

<p>This application of satin-stitch is known
by a number of other names, such as
‘Long-and-short’ stitch, ‘Plumage’ or
‘Feather’ stitch; the latter name is rather
misleading, as there is a well-known stitch
of that name, quite different in appearance
and method of working, in common use in
linen embroidery. In reading descriptions
of silk embroidery one should bear in mind
that when Feather-stitch is mentioned it <i>may</i>
mean the one described above.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/illus8.jpg" width="225" height="300" alt="Diagram B" />
</div>

<p><i>B</i> is worked in the three lightest
shades of the bronze-green—Nos. 112, 113,
and 113<span class="smcapuc">A</span>. The method is precisely the
same as in <i>A</i> above, only the radiation is
different and requires even more care in the
arrangement of the stitches. Radiation of
lines from a centre follows a principle of
natural growth, as anyone may observe by
taking the separate petals of any similar
flower; all the lines and veinings, however
much branched or netted, will be seen to
converge towards the point where it is
inserted into the calyx. In the leaf the
place where they converge is the midrib—an
extended centre, so to speak—and in ‘B’
the stitches are aimed in the same direction.
Imagination has to be called upon to suggest
where the lines should run in the part of the
leaf which turns over, but it should always
be done intelligently.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus9.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Diagrams C and D" />
</div>

<p><i>C</i> is more conventional, by which I mean
less regard is paid to natural growth. It
is a favourite method with the Chinese
and Japanese, who work this form of satin-stitch
to such perfection, that the ‘right
side’ and ‘wrong side’ are almost exactly
alike. This may be considered a test of
good workmanship. It is best to begin
with the part nearest the centre, with the
darkest shade of blue. Each stitch of one
petal is parallel with the others and in a
vertical direction; there is no radiation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the working of individual petals, only in the
arrangement of the petals themselves in the
whole flower; and the edge of each shade is
sharply defined by a voided line instead of
melting or ‘shading’ into the next. A
voided line is a narrow space of the ground
left bare between the rows of stitches; it
should be so narrow and so even as to look
like a fine line or indentation in the silk.
This kind of satin-stitch is equally suited to
work done all in one shade or in white on
white ground.</p>

<p><i>D</i> is also worked in parallel lines, but
the direction is horizontal, the shades lying
side by side close together. In quite small
flowers the stitches would go straight across
each petal, but in larger ones, like these,
half is worked at a time, a voided line being
left down the middle of each. In the
sampler it is also left to define each shade,
but <i>D</i> is a simpler form for practice.</p>

<p><i>E</i> is worked somewhat like <i>A</i>, only the
stitches follow all along the curve equally
as the veins do in lily-leaves, &amp;c., instead
of radiating. This should be begun with
the darkest of the bronze-greens, No. 113<span class="smcapuc">B</span>.
Two rows may be worked with this, then
one of the next shade, 113<span class="smcapuc">A</span>, then three
of the next, 113, then one of 113<span class="smcapuc">A</span> to finish
with.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus10.jpg" width="300" height="325" alt="Diagrams F, G and I" />
</div>

<p>The three berries marked <i>F</i> on the
sampler are slightly raised. The preparation
may be the same as that described in the
chapter on gold-work; padding thread sewn
across and across in several directions, or by
layers of parchment cut to the shape. In
any case the padding must be covered with
stitches of silk, worked straight across, in
the opposite direction to that with which it
is covered eventually. The same shade,
No. 105, may be used for all berries, but
each should be worked in a different direction,
to show the effect that such a change has
on the tone of the colour.</p>

<p>The centres of the flowers, marked <i>G</i>,
are begun with the brown silk, with surface
satin-stitch, in which, as its name implies,
nearly all the silk is on the surface of the
material. It is just taken through and
brought up again close to, but not exactly
in, the point where it went down, leaving a
very small stitch at the back, then taken
across the space to be covered, and through
again on the opposite side in the same
manner. The stitches may lie either horizontally
or vertically. Over this work a
single thread of No. 92 is drawn diagonally,
at regular intervals, to form a lattice.
These overlying stitches, again, are sewn
down by a small cross-stitch at each intersection.</p>

<p>This lattice-work may be used independently,
without any under-stitching, showing
the ground instead; it has a very pretty
light effect among more solid work. Another
pattern is shown at <i>G2</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Split-stitch.</span>—This is a stitch found
much in use in the earliest specimens of
ecclesiastical needlework. I believe that
the faces and heads of nearly all the figure
work done before the fifteenth century were
in split-stitch. The effect is something like
several others. When very fine and rather
tightly worked it looks like satin-stitch;
when looser, like fine chain-stitch; when
coarse and rather loose, like crewel-stitch
worked backwards and forwards. Each
stitch is worked by making a small satin-stitch
and bringing the needle up from the
back <i>through</i> the middle of it, or by threading
the needle with <i>two</i> strands of silk and bringing
the point up <i>between</i> them. See illustrations
of ancient Coptic work, where the
frayed ends of silk show plainly that it was
done in this way.</p>

<p>The silk is thus pierced through or
‘split’—hence its name.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus11.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="Diagram h" />
</div>

<p><i>H</i> on the sampler is worked thus:—</p>

<p>With a needleful of No. 135 begin at the
lower end of the inside half of the leaf and
follow the inner curve as far as the point of
the first lobe. Almost every alternate row
of stitches is carried only halfway down, or
less, to keep the radiation right. When the
first lobe is filled, take the next shade (134)
and work in the same manner up to the top
point of the leaf. The other half of the top
point and the upper part of the next lobe is
worked with the lightest shade, 133<span class="smcapuc">A</span>, and
the last with 134; <i>h</i> shows the upper part
of the leaf in course of being worked.</p>

<p>We now come to laid-work, the general
character of which I have already described
above.</p>

<p>The first process is to cover the surface
with the silken threads, lying all in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
direction—vertical at <i>I</i>, horizontal at <i>J</i>, on
the sampler.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus12.jpg" width="350" height="400" alt="Diagram J" />
</div>

<p>They can be laid at any angle, provided
that the stitches are kept parallel with each
other, and that due consideration is given
to the direction the over-stitching will take.
It ought to cross the laid stitches as nearly
as possible at right angles to keep it nicely
in place. Of course, it is impossible to keep
strictly to this, but if the principal veinings
are placed thus the others will naturally
approximate sufficiently.</p>

<p>The silk may either be carried through
the material and the needle brought up a
very little way further on along the outline,
as in surface-satin; or the silk may be
turned back on the surface, as in couching,
with a stitch at each end. The
middle and darkest shades of grey-green
(134, 135) are used for the leaf, and the
middle and darkest blues for the vase.
The over-stitching of the leaf is in
the lightest grey-green, done with split-stitch;
the vase with the darkest blue in
couching.</p>

<p>The band <i>K</i> at the bottom of the
sampler may be worked in the same way,
using back-stitching to keep it down. With
back-stitching a pattern can be formed which
is something like that made by couching,
only it is softer-looking and more quickly
done. If it is a border of any considerable
length a number of skeins may be all begun
together; then, pinning them all down with
a long fine pin, the stitches are set in at
regular intervals to make the pattern. The
floss-silk in this case requires no needle,
but, when once begun, is ‘paid off’ the reel
or card by degrees as required.</p>

<p>Laid-work makes a beautiful background;
the over-stitching may be either
of split-stitch, couching, or back-stitch, and
may be done either in a pattern or by simple
lines, diagonal, vandyked, or at right angles
with the silk laid down. Compare <i>k</i>,
which is laid, with <i>q</i>, which is couched.
Both may be worked with the middle
shade of blue sewn down with gold-colour,
No. 92.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus13.jpg" width="500" height="175" alt="Diagrams k, p and q" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p><i>M</i> is worked in the same manner as
<i>B</i>, but with the two shades of bronze-green,
Nos. 113 and 113<span class="smcapuc">A</span>.</p>

<p><i>N</i> is filled with darning-stitch, the
lines following the direction of the curve.
Darning cannot be done in a frame in the
same manner as when held loose in the
hand. The needle must go in with one
hand and be drawn down with the other,
the same as with all work done in a frame.
The stitches are about a quarter of an inch
long and a very little of the ground is left
between each. The rows of stitches also
lie close together. The shading and proportion
should be done to match <i>E</i>, and
the different shades should ‘dovetail’ into
each other as in the satin-stitch.</p>

<p>The parts of the leaves marked <i>O</i> are
worked with the grey-green, No. 135, in
radiating lines, not quite close together,
showing about an equal quantity of the
ground between. This partial filling, both
in couching and in darning, is very effective
for light work, but an outline is absolutely
necessary, and is really the principal part of
the work. The outline may be either couched
or worked in crewel-stitch, like <i>p</i>.</p>

<p>Crewel-stitch, like darning, is not worked
in the frame in the same way as in the hand.
After fastening on the thread, bring it out
at the bottom of the work and set the needle
in about an eighth of an inch higher up on
the traced line. Draw it down and bring it
up again close to the place where it was
brought out at first. Set it in again an
eighth of an inch higher than the first stitch,
that will make a stitch a quarter of an inch
long: keep them about this length all the
time. (In turning a sharp curve they should
be shorter, and in a long straight line they
may be a very little longer, worked in coarse
silk.) Care must be taken not to pierce the
stitch when bringing the needle through
from the back; the method of working is
the same as in split-stitch, with this exception,
which makes all the difference! It
may be necessary to hold back the stitch
to avoid piercing it, especially on the inner
side of a curved line, for the needle must
always be kept on the same side of the
stitch as it is begun, otherwise it will make
a break in the curve. It has, moreover, a
different name when worked on one side
from that which it has when worked on the
other—<i>crewel</i> when the needle comes out on
the Left, <i>outline</i> when it comes out on the
Right. There are other names given to this
stitch, according to the many slight variations
in the way of working it. When, for
instance, instead of bringing the needle out
on the line, it is taken a little way off it, so
as to make a more slanting stitch, it is
called stem-stitch (see stems marked <i>R</i> on
sampler), but as this is in reality a narrow
strip of satin-stitch, worked diagonally, it
does not seem to require a name of its own.</p>

<p><i>U</i> is couched with the dark grey-green
silks, the shades being placed side by side.</p>

<p><i>S</i> and <i>T</i> are narrow strips of slanting
satin-stitch. All straight-lined Lettering
looks well worked thus, outlined with an
edge of couched gold or silver.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">ON OUTLINE AND APPLIQUÉ</span></h2>

<p>Hitherto we have considered outline merely
as it is traced upon the material to be enriched
by embroidery—as a boundary for the
needle to work to; or when an outline has
been placed round the edges of the stitching,
simply to make it neat. In this chapter I
propose to deal with <span class="smcapuc">OUTLINE</span> as a distinct
method of ornamentation, used independently
of any ‘filling’; as an adjunct to appliqué;
and as enclosing portions of the background
to be further enriched, but not entirely
covered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Outline work</span> is often looked down upon
by the expert embroidress as a kind of
needlework quite unworthy of her serious
attention, because it requires very little technical
skill; while, as to <span class="smcapuc">APPLIQUÉ</span>, it is not
to be mentioned, being almost beneath contempt!</p>

<p>This attitude towards the simpler kinds
of decoration merely shows a want of artistic
perception. Walter Crane gives outline in
general its true position when he says it
may be called the ‘Alpha and Omega of
art,’ being the earliest mode of expression
among primitive peoples and children, and
also cultivated for its power of expression,
character, and as an ‘ultimate test of
draughtsmanship by the most accomplished
artists of all time.’<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Outline and appliqué go naturally together
because they are very often mutually dependent
upon each other, appliqué nearly
always requiring an outline, and outline
frequently being partially filled with appliqué.</p>

<p>Outline may really be considered more
purely artistic work than elaborate embroidery,
because it depends more entirely
upon the merit of the design for its beauty,
being unable to hide its defects under a maze
of intricate stitchery or to carry away the
mind of the beholder by the glory of various
colours.</p>

<p>In early and medieval times needlework
as an adjunct to weaving and outline work
by itself was used with a most perfect
artistic effect, done in couched metals or
silken cord, or in simple chain-stitch or
back-stitch, &amp;c.; while, as for appliqué,
many gorgeous vestments may still be seen
retaining much of their original beauty,
worked in satin on velvet, silk upon damask,
&amp;c., Botticelli and other great masters not
disdaining to draw designs for such work
with their own hands.</p>

<p>There are several reasons for the employment
of special outline in embroidery
besides the elementary one of marking out
the shape. In a picture such lines are not
only unnecessary, but objectionable in the
finished work; why, then, are they admirable
here? The object of art needlework
is <i>not</i> to make pictures (however beautiful
they might be), but so to decorate certain
textile articles—of furniture, clothing, &amp;c.—that
they do not lose their natural characteristics,
but become themselves more truly
beautiful. Figures, foliage, inflorescence,
&amp;c., should not stand out from their background
like <i>real things</i>, but become actually
part of the textile itself.</p>

<p>This being the case, we are debarred
from the employment of naturalistic half-tones,
shadows and reflected lights by which
a painter makes the different objects in his
picture at the same time harmonious in
colour, distinct from each other, and altogether
life-like in appearance.</p>

<p>In decorative art the use of a good, bold
outline separates the colours, defines the
form, harmonises the general effect, and
increases the appearance of flatness.</p>

<p>The isolation of various colours by
means of an outline is especially desirable
in work which is to be seen from a distance,
because masses of colour when placed in
direct contact with each other become blurred
and lose their true relation and value.</p>

<p>In the same circumstances the <i>form</i> is
also apt to lose its proportions to some
extent on account of the propensity of white
and all light colours to spread themselves
and increase their apparent size.</p>

<p>A very happy use of outline is sometimes
made as a softener of general effect both
for appliqué and many kinds of embroidery
by the addition of a secondary outline beyond
the boundary of the ornament, sometimes
of the same colour, but frequently of
a paler shade, or altogether different.</p>

<p>Or again, in conjunction with appliqué,
the outline frequently breaks out into more
or less fanciful and luxurious scroll-work,

work.</p>

</div>

<p>Illustration IV. shows a good example of
this, one half of which I have drawn without
scroll-work to show what a difference
it makes. It is outlined throughout with
four threads of fine gold, sewn down all
together very closely with green silk round
the leaves; the double set of four threads,
meeting at the base of the leaves, form the
stem, and are also sewn closely with green.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
On the white ornament the gold is sewn
with yellow, and there is an inner line of
blue all round; also stitches of blue silk are
placed in pairs across the white satin all
the way down. All the scroll-work is done
in gold twist, the same thickness as the
outline of four gold threads sewn together.</p>

<p>It is generally desirable thus to work all
small detail occurring in appliqué designs;
they should be done on the ground itself
after the pattern has been transferred to it.
The design used for this kind of work should
always be bold and broad, unmistakable in
its language and graceful in its expression,
and so arranged as to make the best account
of the materials to be employed. Several
different textures may be used to enhance
the richness and interest of the composition,
but it can be made very beautiful with only
two—one for the ground and one for the
onlay. The same may be said with regard
to the colours. Any two of sufficient harmony
or contrast between the ground and
the pattern are sufficient, and perhaps more
certain of good result in the hands of the
inexperienced than a variety of colours
might be.</p>

<p>Appliqué is particularly suitable for altar-frontals
and sanctuary hangings; the finer
work and smaller patterns such as Figs. III.
and IV., make very effective and handsome
apparels for dalmatics and albes, and
orphreys for chasubles.</p>

<p>Appliqué can also be used for banners,
where effect is really more desirable than
over-much work. Quite beautiful is such
a banner showing figures of saints or angels
in bright raiment, well drawn, expressive,
and with few details (something in the
style of good stained-glass), where the full
value of pure colour is obtainable and the
changing light in a procession modifies or
accentuates the tones alternately in a most
delightful manner. Needless to say such
designs must be fully coloured before the
materials are chosen, and the greatest care
must be exercised to see that they harmonise;
nothing short of seeing the actual
pieces of silk together will accomplish this;
small snippings or threads of silk are useless
for the purpose. And the outlines must be
sufficiently thick and well marked to keep
the colours distinct. A ‘cool’ dark brown
or a ‘warm’ dark grey is preferable to black
for this purpose.</p>

<p>The various fabrics used for appliqué
may be prepared in the following manner.</p>

<p>In the first place embroidery paste has
to be made, although many substitutes
have been tried with more or less success.
If there is a large quantity to prepare,
it is better to make the paste than to try
‘cobbler’s paste’ or photograph mountant,
though either will do very well for small
pieces of work or to paste the back of embroidery
which has been done in a frame
to be mounted afterwards. In this latter
case a small quantity of the paste is carefully
rubbed on the back of the work with
the tips of the fingers, and then thin tough
paper stuck to it before cutting it out of the
frame: the paper should be crumpled up
and then slightly smoothed out before
applying it to the work, or it is apt to
contract in the course of drying, with
disastrous results.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Embroidery Paste</span> is made thus: mix
3 oz. fine wheaten flour (<i>not</i> ‘<i>self-raising</i>,’
‘<i>whole meal</i>,’ or any fancy kind), 2 dr.
finely powdered resin, ½ pint distilled water
(cold). It must be perfectly smooth before
putting on the stove to boil; it can be
strained through a sieve if necessary. It
must be kept well stirred, especially as it
approaches boiling point, when it thickens
and requires vigorous action to prevent it
from burning or getting lumpy.</p>

<p>When once the whole mass boils, it
becomes thinner and clearer, and must be
kept boiling for <i>at least</i> five minutes.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>A piece of Bishop’s lawn (mounted in a
frame) is next covered with as thin a layer
of the paste as can be spread smoothly all
over it; a large strong brush is used for
this, a hog’s-hair tool such as house-painters
use, round or flat. Then lay the material to
be mounted upon the pasted surface, pat
and stroke it down gently with a soft silk or
linen rag to make sure that it is in contact
with the paste evenly throughout, then pin
or tack it firmly all round, and screw or peg
the frame up taut. Air bubbles and creases
would spoil it altogether. It is then left
twenty-four hours to dry. If required sooner,
it may be placed in a warm dry room, not too
near the fire, but near enough to hasten the
drying, or a warm flat-iron may be passed
over the back; but the face of the silk or
velvet must not be touched with anything;
the iron must not be nearly so hot as a
laundress would use; it is better, if possible,
to let it dry naturally; there is less risk of
damaging the material; and as it is rather
a delicate process from first to last, it is
advisable to experiment with something of
little value to begin with.</p>

<p>Small pieces of stuff are much easier to
mount than large ones. The whole of the
pasted surface in the frame may be covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
with different pieces, but they must all be
put on while the paste is wet, and of course
it is not <i>necessary</i> to paste the whole of the
‘backing’ if it will not be used, though it
will dry more evenly if it is at least wiped
over with a damp cloth where there is no
paste.</p>

<p>When the mounted material is thoroughly
dry, it may be cut out of the frame and laid,
face downwards, on a board, when the shapes
required should be marked out on the linen,
and cut with a sharp knife or scissors. The
appliqué should be accurately traced from
the same drawing as that used for the whole
of the work; but it must be remembered
that whatever is drawn on the linen backing
will be reversed when seen on the ‘right’
side. The shapes should always be cut out
a trifle larger than the drawing, rather than
smaller.</p>

<p>The ground for the appliqué being
mounted in a frame, and the design traced,
nothing remains to be done but to tack each
detail firmly down in its place and couch
round the edges with filoselle or gold, &amp;c.
The tacking stitches may be of fine
white cotton taken right across and
withdrawn after the work is finished;
but in any case a small stitch of the
same colour as the onlay should be
placed through any sharp point there
may be, to prevent it catching in the
silk, or getting curled out of shape
while being worked round. These
stitches will not be taken out afterwards.
A few stitches are also desirable
down the centres of leaves, flowers,
&amp;c., so that they may keep flat as well as in
place.</p>

<p>Some method should be kept to in cutting
the appliqué a certain way in the stuff; there
is a distinct difference in colour when it is
cut <i>with</i> the warp or <i>across</i> it, or again,
diagonally. Take satin for example: cut a
leaf or the petal of a flower with the ‘smooth’
of the satin going in one direction, and then
cut another exactly similar, with the satin in
a different direction, and place them side by
side; it will be evident at once that this
quality of textile fabrics (<i>i.e.</i> the change of
colour according to direction of warp and
weft) must be reckoned with and used intelligently.
It is common to all in a more
or less marked degree, and follows the same
principle which I have pointed out when
speaking of the <i>direction</i> of stitches. Flowers
(if more than an inch in diameter) look best
with the petals cut separately, all one way
of the stuff, and arranged so as to radiate
from the centre. Leaves can be cut with
each half starting towards the midrib; but
too much cutting about is not desirable.</p>

<p>Appliqué is intended to have a somewhat
flat effect. Quite sufficient variety can
generally be obtained by varying the direction
of the whole leaf, and by adding veins
in couched, or crewel, or split stitch. A mass
of French knots or a diaper over a different-coloured
silk for the centres of flowers may
combine very well with appliqué, but any
other additional stitches should be resorted
to but rarely. It should not look like an
imitation of work done entirely by the needle,
and much stitchery mixed with it or worked
upon it is apt to give a false impression,
besides weakening the character of the work,
which should be simple and dignified, with
no fussiness about it. If much variety is
desired, it can always be produced by the
judicious selection of different materials.
There is great diversity of surface effect in
satin, diaper, damask and corded silks, while
velvet is indeed more different than any added
stitch would be.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. V.—Counter-change Inlay</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Inlay</span> is something like appliqué in
appearance. It is, however, worked differently,
the decoration being <i>set into</i> the
fabric to be ornamented instead of being laid
upon it. It ought to be worked in cloth
or some substantial kind of material not
liable to fray at the edges when cut. It
is eminently suitable for church hangings,
dorsals or wings, &amp;c., having a certain
nobility and sincerity about it, while all it
asks of the worker is accuracy in the cutting
and neatness in the sewing. The hand and
eye of women are so much more trained
nowadays than they used to be, by means of
various arts and crafts, that it ought to be a
matter of course to follow a line perfectly
with a sharp knife on cloth, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The method of work is as follows: Two
pieces of cloth of different colours and
about equal thickness are tacked together
and pinned down to a board with drawing-pins.
The pattern is traced on the top one,
and the two are then cut together with a
very sharp knife (a leather-cutter’s knife is
good for this purpose). The blade of the
knife must be kept vertical, that ground and
inlet may be of the same size. They are
then taken off the board and tacked down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
linen already mounted in a frame, carefully
fitting the two colours into each other. If
the pattern be a counter-change design,
there will be absolutely no waste of the
stuff, as the piece which is cut out of the
one material is set into the other.</p>

<p>When the edges have been sewn together
(which is done with plain over-sewing not
going through the linen—and is best worked
<i>out</i> of the frame) the linen is removed and
the outline added if required. This may be
of cord or gold or narrow braid, or chain-stitching
answers this purpose very well,
especially as it is done loose in the hand. If
a thinner material, or one more liable to fray
is used, it is better to keep it in the frame
throughout, and work through the linen;
but it is not such a perfect method,
as there is a ‘wrong side’ to it,
which there should not be in the
other. Neither will it hang in such
soft folds, especially if it is pasted on
to the linen, as some recommend.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. VI</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chain-stitch</span>, which I have mentioned
as a suitable stitch to cover
the join when working in inlay, may
be described here, as it is very useful
for any work that is not done in a
frame. It has been so much imitated
by means of the sewing-machine in
modern times as to be somewhat out
of favour, but it need not look
mechanical if used with discretion.
It makes a beautiful even line, following
any curve with great precision
and ease, and will always find its
place at the hands of the competent worker,
either as an outline stitch or a filling.</p>

<p>It is done by setting the needle into the
stuff at the same place it came out, the
thread lying under the thumb of the left
hand. A small piece of the stuff is taken up
by the needle in the right hand, and the
thread drawn not too tightly (beginners
always make their chain-stitch
too tight); the needle is then set in
as before, exactly in the same place
where it came out. The ‘wrong
side’ of the work should look like
back-stitching.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. VII</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">French Knots</span>, which are placed
in the middle of each of the grapes in
Illustration I., are extremely useful,
whether in masses, singly, or in lines
following an outline; they may be
used as a filling, or scattered over
the ground, where they will break
the colour in a very pleasing manner
and add to the richness of general
effect. Purse-silk, or some other
kind of thick, firm variety of silk,
is best for knots. Floss used double and
twisted together is very satisfactory; in pale
shades or white it has the effect of pearls.</p>

<p>After fastening the end firmly to begin
with, bring the needle to the surface, take
the thread up on it from right to left, holding
the thread with the left hand, give the needle
one turn and set it vertically into the stuff
near the point it came out, but not exactly
on it. The thread should still be held in the
left hand till it has all gone through, leaving
the knot on the surface. It should not be
twisted more than once round the needle.
If a larger knot is wanted, thicker silk
should be used; knots made with two or
three twists on the needle do not lie well in
their place.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>V. &amp; A. Museum, S. Kensington (No. 124—1891).</i></p>
</div>

<p>In the last chapter, when speaking of
appliqué, I had occasion to mention how
well it lends itself to representation of the
human form, to be worked on a fairly large
scale. I consider it eminently suitable for
this because of the slight amount of stitchery
required to produce the desired effect, the
features being merely outlined, with the
exception perhaps of the eyes and lips,
which might be worked solid.</p>

<p>Large masses of drapery, &amp;c., are tedious
to work and may very well be represented by
a piece of beautiful woven material; while
the features and limbs, if well-drawn to
start with, may be outlined accurately by
skilful fingers without calling for a greater
knowledge of anatomy or artistic expression
than the average embroidress may be
expected to possess.</p>

<p>But now we have come to figure-work
as a special branch of Church embroidery.
My own opinion may be briefly stated that
only those who can <i>draw</i> correctly ought to
attempt it, because, of all methods of representation,
needlework is one of the least
direct, and therefore one of the most difficult.</p>

<p>It is possible, perhaps, to get a fairly
satisfactory figure worked by a person who
cannot draw, if the principal lines and
shading are distinctly marked out on the
material to be worked, as well as a fully
coloured drawing provided by the designer.
But stitching is not, so to speak, a natural
medium for expressing ideas, and the
slightest deviation from what is intended
by the artist may result in something
entirely different in character—approaching,
possibly, very near the grotesque on the one
hand, or frivolity on the other. And as we
seem in these days of general but superficial
education of the masses, to have almost lost
the feeling of reverence for religious effigies,
looked upon as <i>symbols</i> only, irrespective of
any æsthetic properties they may or may not
possess, it is more than ever necessary to
do the <i>best things</i> in the <i>best way</i> we know
of. This is why I would strongly urge all
who wish to enrich their embroideries with
the human figure to practise drawing first.
I would further suggest that the drawing
should be chiefly from the antique, and the
study altogether more with regard to typical
than individual forms, as this training is not
for the painting of ‘pictures,’ but for the
sake of knowing what are the elements of
human beauty and how they ought to be
applied or modified. Neither am I including
the study of design, which, as I have before
remarked, is a study in itself. I am suggesting
only such a practice of drawing as shall
enable the needlewoman to know what is
required of her in following out the idea and
intention of her design, and to be able to
carry out the same intelligently; she will
not then place an eye on the cheek-bone
or an ear on the jaw, or allow the fold of
a garment to suggest a dislocated limb.</p>

<p>It is taken for granted that the embroidress
is already quite dexterous and
proficient in the use of the finest floss-silks
and has had a good deal of practice in the
usual stitches. Her mind should be unencumbered
with any thought of <i>technique</i>, and
the hand should respond without effort.</p>

<p>There is no new stitch to learn for this
work, but there are several ways of employing
the old ones.</p>

<p>Each method being usually associated
with some distinct style or date, it is well to
be conversant with the various standards,
and then the worker is able to choose that
which appeals to her most, or which seems
the right one for any special requirement.</p>

<p>The decoration and vestments of a
church may very well be of a <i>later</i> date
than the building, but it seems a sort of
anachronism to have it distinctively <i>earlier</i>,
unless it actually is a treasure handed down
from past generations.</p>

<p>Among the earliest examples to which
we have access are the remains of Christian
Coptic embroidery, done, it is believed, in
the fifth or sixth century (see Illustration I.)</p>

<p>It is all worked in coarse split-stitch or
(which has much the same effect) by threading
the needle with two strands of silk at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
once and bringing it up from the back
between the two threads. The features are
marked out with dark brown silk, and are
formed in a somewhat rough-and-ready way
by making almost every stitch express a
feature by its direction and colour, the rest
of the face being filled up as best it can.
The hands in the same way; each finger is
simply and crudely expressed by a single or
double row of split-stitch. The garments
are shaded, the rows of stitching following
the direction of the folds.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1236-66</p>
</div>

<p>The earliest English figure work was
usually done also in split-stitch, but much
finer. The faces, hands, and feet were
worked with the stitch all in one direction,
either vertical or horizontal, and the details
marked out with very fine black silk or dark
brown. Sometimes the lips were put in
with red. There was no shading of the
flesh-tints, but they were, so far as one can
tell, quite white. The Worcester fragments
and the Durham stole and maniple are
examples of this work; the latter, being in
such good preservation, is the easiest to
study. The garments and sometimes the
whole figure were worked in gold or silver
thread all laid one way; or again, with the
face-lines vertical and the rest horizontal.
The fragments from the vestment of Walter
de Cantelupe (1236-1265 or 6) show a particularly
beautiful scroll-work in a flowing
pattern all over it. There are many small
figures seated and crowned and holding a
sceptre. The whole of the work is done
entirely in fine gold-thread laid in one direction,
and outlined with dark brown or black
on what seems to have been crimson or
rose-coloured Oriental silk. There is a
small piece of it in the V. and A. Museum
South Kensington, and some more in
Worcester Cathedral Church, from which my
drawing is taken.</p>

‘Syon Cope’ at South Kensington.
One of the characteristics of this work
is the way the faces are treated. Split-stitch
in one shade of fine floss is still used,
but, instead of lying in straight lines, it is
begun in the centre of the cheek and worked
round and round, in more or less circular
lines, till they merge into the semicircular
ones of the neck, or radiate towards the eye-socket
and the straight line of the nose.
The direction of the stitch gives an <i>appearance</i>
of shading, although it is all done in one
shade of very fine silk. The effect of relief
is also attained by the same means, slightly
accentuated by mechanical assistance—possibly
the round head of a metal pin heated and
pressed wherever such an effect is desired.
The figure of St. Paul (Fig. II.) shows the
general effect and the accompanying diagram
(<a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>) the method of work. It will be observed
by anyone who will make the experiment,
that fine split-stitch, crewel, or chain-stitch
worked solid in a circular direction in this
way, if done out of a frame, will naturally
cause such depressions as are to be seen in
the early specimens of ‘Opus Anglicanum.’
It needed very little mechanical appliance to
make these indentations regular and more
effective; but by degrees this desire for
effect grew beyond bounds, and the modelling
became frightfully exaggerated at the
same time that the natural and moderate
relief of eyelids, nose, and lips, caused by a
few extra stitches, developed into an actual
stuffing, till figure embroidery was a thing
of the past, and a debased condition of taste
delighted itself with dolls dressed in silks
and laces attached to needleworked ‘pictures,’
which had to be framed and glazed
to keep them free from dust!</p>

<p>The arrangement of stitches, as in the
‘Opus Anglicanum,’ has been revived in
modern times by some of the Sisterhoods,
where they make a point of being ‘Early
English’; but it is a style apt to become too
quaint to suit modern ideas of reverence, and
it is certainly much more difficult to manage
successfully than the vertical or horizontal
arrangement (see ‘<i>a</i>’ <a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>).</p>

<p>‘<i>b</i>’ shows a combination of both, and
‘<i>c</i>’ of the vertical method. Fig. III.
is a drawing from a figure of the Blessed
Virgin in a group representing the
‘Annunciation’ on an altar-frontal at St.
Thomas’s, Salisbury. The whole of the
frontal is closely ‘parsemé,’ with the typical
Cherubim, Angels, flowers, &amp;c., of the
period (thirteenth to sixteenth centuries)
and very much ornamented with free and
graceful scroll-work. There is a return to
the simpler method for working the face;
or perhaps I should say a continuation of
this method, which has never been entirely
given up, in spite of prevailing fashion; probably
the embroiderer instinctively feels it
to be the most manageable. I mean the
evenly worked surface (be it split-stitch or
satin-stitch) on which the features are
worked in outline. These stitches lie in the
vertical direction, and there is little, if any,
shading. The dress is worked in several
shades of blue (also vertical split-stitch or
fine satin-stitch), and there is very little
attempt to give the appearance of relief in
the folds. The cloak is worked entirely in
gold thread, laid horizontally, with the folds
marked on afterwards in rather scratchy
lines of green silk. The lining of the cloak
is in silver thread, flecked with black to
indicate vair. The hair is pale golden-brown,
in split-stitch, following the natural curves,
and is very delicately drawn and worked.
The whole of the group is characterised by
great simplicity and sweetness. The vase
containing the lilies, which stands in the
centre between the Angel and the Blessed
Virgin, is of richly raised gold-work; a
scroll behind her shoulders with the words
‘Ecce Ancilla Dn̅i’ balances the wings of
the Angel in the composition of the design.</p>

<p>During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
there was a spontaneous growth of
feeling for truth and beauty in all the arts;
more correct drawing and richer colouring
combined with strong and graceful design
to produce perfection in needlework. In the
most beautiful examples of this period (with
few exceptions) the faces are worked in
natural shades of flesh-tints, with fine floss-silks
in satin-stitch, either ‘short’ or ‘long
and short,’ in the vertical direction, with a
fair amount of shading, but no cast shadows.
The garments fall in noble lines and give
the opportunity for a fine variety of colour.
Precious stones, metals, and pearls were
used with moderation, not that lavish profusion
which afterwards degenerated into
vulgar display.</p>

<p>Illustration IV. is taken from part of an

It is a piece of Florentine work, and shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
distinctly the influence of the place and the
age. This reproduction of course does not
do it justice; it is a perfect marvel of colour,
while the drawing shows a master’s hand.
The whole of the architectural background
is worked in gold thread laid horizontally,
the effect both of colour and shading being
entirely produced by means of the silk it is
couched with. In places the gold is completely
veiled by the stitches, in others it
gleams through, and again it is left quite
bare and shining with its own lustre alone.
Every line of the architecture is accentuated
with gold twist of different degrees of thickness,
and sometimes varied again by being
twisted in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The garments consist of the <i>same gold

simply carried through the whole of the
work,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> with the exception of the head and

are done over the gold in short satin-stitch.

finely, and the shading is put in boldly.

<p>The garments of the figures in the older
embroidery were usually worked in split-stitch
in much the same manner as the
faces; that is to say, the stitching is done
in rows, following the lines of the drawing.</p>

<p>In the Syon cope, for instance, the tunic
of the figure illustrated in Fig. II. is worked
in three shades of blue floss; the palest
has faded so much as to be out of range
altogether (a habit unfortunately common
to pale shades of blue); the two darker
ones seem to have remained almost entirely
unaffected by age, light, and wear. The
upper garment is worked in gold thread,
with a border of green and a lining of soft
yellowish-brown floss silk. The gold-work
is done in the same way as the background
of the cope. The threads lie in the same
direction throughout—not merely in the case
of the figure I am describing, but wherever
gold is introduced at all—in large masses,
as in the vesture, or in quite small quantities,
such as the narrow border of the tunic.
It is stitched so as to form the same zigzag
pattern.</p>

<p>The lining of the upper robe is worked
in a very fine split-stitch, with either very
little shading or none besides that which is
caused by the different directions of the
stitch.</p>

<p>The folds in the gold-worked part are
indicated by means of voided lines, which
are afterwards filled up with stitches of
black silk. The voiding at the folds gives
a low relief, as the gold goes down and
comes up again instead of all lying flat on
the surface.</p>

<p>The hair is in fine lines of alternate blue-grey
and white floss, done in split-stitch.
In some of the other figures it is gold and
black, or gold and white, or black and
white, but always in alternate lines in the
same style. In early English work the
bearded faces have the upper lip shaven.</p>

<p>Three shades of each colour are commonly
employed, not often following each
other very closely, especially in the case of
the green, of which the lighter shades incline
towards yellow and the darker towards
blue.</p>

<p>There were very few different colours
in general use for embroidery till towards
the end of the fourteenth century, after
which they became much more varied, but
still more harmonious, till crude and violent
colours came in with the nineteenth century.
The dyes formerly were mostly from Eastern
sources, whence the silks also came, and
where, until quite lately, very stringent rules
were in force concerning the colours and
dyes permitted to be used.</p>

<p><i>D’or nué</i> seems to have been the favourite
method of doing the garments about the
sixteenth century. Laid-work, kept down
with either self-coloured silk or gold thread,
lightly couched, is also to be seen; and later,
a pretty use of short-stitch in floss, worked
vertically over gold threads laid horizontally—something
like <i>d’or nué</i>, but very much
coarser and more practical for the larger
figures, which were then becoming more
frequently worked (see diagram).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">
<img src="images/illus27.jpg" width="475" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Diagram showing method of working
Short-stitch over horizontal lines of
Gold-thread</p>
</div>

<p>Another way of treating drapery is to
work it solidly in long-and-short-stitch (vertical),
boldly shaded, and afterwards enriching
it with fine gold threads laid horizontally
over the whole garment a little distance
apart, and sewn down singly with fine sewing
silks or split floss of the same shades as
those it passes over; or sprays or diapers
may be effective worked over the plain
shaded silks.</p>

<p>The background of figure-work is not
very often composed entirely of stitching in
these days, when so many beautiful woven
fabrics are so easily procured and time seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
shorter than it used to be. But still, where
there is not a very large expanse to fill, a
worked background is not a luxury unattainable;
a very satisfactory and glorious one is
gold thread laid in diaper-patterns. Laid-work
and darning are quicker—the latter
makes a beautifully broken colour for showing
up large outline figure-work done on
unbleached linen or worsted material for
hangings.</p>

<p>I do not fancy any of my readers would
undertake such a piece of work as the background
of the Syon cope; but the way it was
probably done has been suggested by Mr.
Lewis Day thus:—</p>

<p>‘The stitch runs from point to point of
the zigzag pattern, then it penetrates the
stuff, is carried round a thread of flax laid
at the back of the material, and is brought
to the surface again through the hole made
by the needle in passing down. That is
to say, the silken thread only <i>dips</i> through
the linen at the points in the pattern, and
is then caught down by a thread of flax on
the under-surface of the linen … it is a
kind of work on which two persons might
be employed, one on either side of the
stuff.’<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>I venture to differ from his opinion on
one point only, and that is that probably
the silken or gold thread was not the one
worked backwards and forwards through
the stuff, since the flax thread from behind
would do the work just as well. The gold
or silk would thus be saved from friction,
and would not need to be cut into needlefuls
and threaded in a needle, but could be used
from continuously, as I have before suggested
for long lines of couching; it is, in
fact, precisely the same thing, with the
exception of taking the ‘working’ needle
back through the hole it made, instead of at
a little distance from it. This method is so
often used in fine gold-work for turning at
the end of a row when one does not want
it to appear on the surface that I fancy it
would be suggested by this.</p>

<span class="smaller">ON LITURGICAL COLOURS, FRONTALS, ETC.</span></h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption">(<i>Suggested as Centre for Frontal, Fig. I.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The question of liturgical colours need not
be very fully discussed here, as this is pre-eminently
a practical manual and not a
treatise on ritual. Although the embroidress
naturally studies the reason and uses of
the things she makes, it does not properly
rest with her whether the ‘Use of Sarum’
or that of any other special diocese be
followed. There certainly seems to have
been no very hard and fast rule observed in
this matter in the early ages of the Church
or even in medieval times. From the old
inventories we gather that altar-frontals and
vestments existed of almost every known
colour and shade (and some indeed <i>unknown</i>
ones, to us at least!). This of course may
be to some extent accounted for by the
votive offerings so frequently made by kings
and nobles of their own magnificent vestments
and of spoils taken in war.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> These
would be accepted and used in the Church
quite irrespective of colour and design.</p>

<p>We might conclude from the old English
illuminations that red, blue, purple, white,
and gold were the colours most generally
used, or considered most ideally correct;
but on more careful investigation I think
we should be driven to the conclusion that
while the careful miniaturist drew the <i>forms</i>
of what he was accustomed to see in the
ordinary services of the Church, he coloured
them according to his own ideas of beauty
or according to the limitations of his palette.
A row of clergy in one illumination, for
instance, would have their albes alternately
blue and red; and I remember another of an
outdoor procession in which the same arrangement
prevailed, with the priests’ stoles
coloured blue over the red albes and red over
the blue ones.</p>

<p>The four colours above-named being the
Levitical ones, it is probable that a particular
significance was attached to them; but green
and black were common before the end of
the fifteenth century; and the English use,
which was supposed to be definitely settled
by the ‘second year of Edward the Sixth,’
certainly includes them.</p>

<p>This gives us an authorised sequence of
at least five colours—viz. white, red, violet,
green, and black. Cloth of gold may be
considered as glorified white. Blue, violet,
indigo, and purple <i>may</i> be all separate
colours, or they may be included in the one
term ‘violet,’ as popularly understood.
‘Purple’ indeed is such a wide-embracing
word that it may, in ancient documents,
signify a <i>material</i> (velvet), while as a colour
it may range anywhere between crimson and
blue, but it always means something rich and
gorgeous.</p>

<p>The altar-frontal, giving the keynote for
the colour, should be arranged for first;
then the vestments worn by the ministers;
and, lastly, all the other textile decorations,
which must harmonise with the whole. It
should not be necessary to change these latter
whenever the altar-frontal is changed, except
for Lent. It becomes all the more desirable
therefore to choose such hangings as will
look equally well with white, green, or red.</p>

<p>For Lent they will all be mostly violet—violet
and red—(red decoration on violet
should be edged with black)—violet and
white—by which I do not mean a bleached,
cold, dead white, but a warm, brownish
cream, or silver. The violet also must not
be crude; blue is preferable generally, and
it need not be as dark as it too often is,
tending to blackness, especially in velvet.
Indigo seems to me the ideal colour for
Lent. When one speaks of <i>blue</i> for Lent,
of course one does not mean bright or
cerulean blue, or azure. These are the
blues of our Lord’s garments, of the Blessed
Virgin, and of the Seraphim, and have
nothing to do with penitence.</p>

<p>The green should not be too blue in
tone, and the red is best kept to tawny
shades, or real, true red. However beautiful
any one colour may be alone, its behaviour
in company with others must be tested if it
is to be used with them. I must plead for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
forgiveness if I seem to press this point
unduly, on the ground that I am constantly
made to suffer from a disregard to this
principle when I am asked to devise new
decorations to ‘go with’ impossible crudities.</p>

<p>Wherever possible, it is best to arrange
all the textile hangings, vestments, &amp;c., to
be used in a church at the same time, and
to have a definite scheme of design and
colour to work upon. Even when the funds
necessary to carry it out are not available
all at once, the general idea could be fixed
upon and the accomplishment of it could
follow by degrees. Too often there appears
to be a sort of haphazard effect in the
decoration of churches—a want of unity, as
though each separate thing were an after-thought,
bearing no relation to what had
been done before. If there are valuable
embroideries, &amp;c., already in use, which only
require to be supplemented by others, it is
merely reasonable to insist upon, and not
difficult to arrange, that the new ones do
not clash with the old. I do not myself
think it necessary to keep rigidly to one
date or style so long as the work harmonises
<i>as a whole</i>, neither is it necessary for all the
shades of every colour used to be identical;
but it is quite essential that they should be
harmonious.</p>

<p>The principal hangings in use in our
time are the Altar-frontal, Super-frontal,
Dorsal and Wings. Curtains are also
sometimes used to partition off part of the
church for a vestry, a belfry, or an organ-chamber.</p>

<p>Besides these there are hangings simply
for the purpose of covering bare walls, in the
chancel or elsewhere.</p>

<p>As a general principle one may say that
curtains which were originally intended to
be drawn or looped back may hang in folds,
while those used merely as a covering should
hang plain.</p>

<p>Wings or riddells, portières, &amp;c., should
be full; altar-frontals, dorsals, and tapestries
for bare walls should hang plain, and may be
treated more pictorially.</p>

<p>The altar strikes the <i>keynote</i>, so to speak,
for the whole church. To it, as the culminating
point, all the decoration is directed;
and by it we are led through the different
seasons of fast and festival, marking these
seasons by the change of vesture as definitely
as by the changes in the ritual and
service.</p>

<p>An altar-frontal is rather a large piece of
work for one person to undertake, unless
she has had considerable practice (which
enables her to work quickly) and has plenty
of time to devote to it, and is also possessed
of sufficient patience to keep on with one
thing till it is finished.</p>

<p>A frontal can very well be worked by
several ladies, each taking a separate piece
on her own frame. Almost every kind of
design can be worked in this way, and that
is why Church work is so often done on
linen and applied to the silk or velvet afterwards.
There is a popular idea that it <i>must</i>
be done so, but this is by no means the case;
it is merely a matter of convenience. It is
more <i>ideally</i> perfect as a matter of <i>principle</i>
to work directly on the material to be
beautified.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/illus29.jpg" width="650" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. I</p>
</div>

<p>In describing how to make up a frontal
we will take one for an 8-foot altar, 3 feet
4 inches high. We will suppose the various
details of an Early English one (such as
Fig. I.) to be already worked and pasted
at the back with embroidery paste as described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
in the chapter on Appliqué-work, cut
out of the frames and neatly ‘trimmed’
round the edges, leaving such a line of linen
as will be perfectly covered with the outline
with which it is couched down to the
material the frontal is to be made of.
Supposing it to be damask, with a pattern
that repeats every 3 feet, and that it is from
25 to 27 inches wide; 4 yards only would be
required, as there would be no extra length
wanted to make the patterns join exactly at
the seams. There would be three seams,
which must be neatly sewn, either with very
fine over-sewing, or with back-stitching, in
silk of the same colour, taking the greatest
care to match the halves of the pattern all
along the seam. When this is done there
will be a continuous surface of damask 36
inches wide and 100 or more inches long.</p>

<p>A large strong frame must be prepared
with stout linen mounted in it, rather larger
than the frontal is to be—say 8 feet 6
inches × 3 feet 6 inches.</p>

<p>Now it makes no difference to the
convenience of working how <i>long</i> the frame
is; but no woman could work to the centre
of one mounted 42 inches wide. One cannot
comfortably work further in than about 13
inches; therefore, although the linen should
be of the full width, not more than twice 13,
viz. 26 inches, should be presented to be
worked upon at one time. The easiest way
to arrange this is to run a tuck along the
top and bottom of the linen before it is put
into the frame, or two tucks along the
bottom, according to the particular requirements
of the design. A chain-stitch sewing
machine would do this firmly and quickly, as
it is only to reduce the width temporarily,
and it could be as quickly undone after it had
served its purpose.</p>

<p>If the long bars of the frame be <i>round</i>
instead of <i>flat</i>, both linen and silk may be
wound upon it to reduce the width to start
with. This involves the removal of the sidebars
each time the work is ‘let out’; they
should not be taken out altogether, neither
should the lacing be quite undone, but merely
loosened sufficiently for the bars to slip
gently out of their sockets; there should be
one person stationed at each side-bar while
this is being done, to see that it is moved
evenly and laced up as before, only with
additional lacing where it has been let out.</p>

<p>A straight line should be marked down
the middle of the linen; it is best run in
with coloured silk or cotton to show on both
the under and the upper sides, as this will be
the starting-point for all measurements.</p>

<p>The central line of the damask is next
found, and tacked down to the one on the
linen. The seams will have been pressed
open and flat, and the selvedges nicked
pretty deeply with sharp scissors all along;
if there is a hard edge, it should be cut off.
The damask should then be well stretched
over the linen, which should not, as yet, be
made as tight as it will go; <i>after</i> the silk is
on (fastened first by pins and then sewn all
round), the whole must be stretched up as
well and evenly as possible. See that the
angles of the frame are right angles, whether
the sides are set in with pegs or screws;
all measurements should be taken quite
accurately by means of a tape that will not
‘give.’ Chesterman’s metallic ones are
perfect, but require care in using, as they
easily break and get out of order. A large
‘straight-edge’ and ‘set-square’ are also
necessary. The frontal is now ready for the
embroidery. The central ornament is placed
on first; then those on each side; then the
others beyond.</p>

<p>The measure can be pinned at each end
of the frame to see that the upper points are
even, and again to verify the lower ones.
Sometimes the design of the damask may be
taken as a guide if evenly woven; and <i>quite</i>
accurately put on the frame; but that should
be tested first.</p>

<p>When each flower has been carefully
placed and kept in position by means of
numerous fine steel pins stuck vertically
through the work, they must all be tacked
firmly with stitches of fine strong silk or
cotton straight down the centre and then
into any outstanding points. These stitches
should be very small on the ‘right’ side of
the work so that they need not be taken out
after it is finished. Then the whole of the
outline is couched over the edges of the
work covering the little border of linen left
for this purpose on cutting it out of the
frame. Two, three, or even four full thicknesses
of filoselle, four or more of ‘Stout
Floss,’ or of gold thread, make an excellent
outline for gold and silk embroidery, according
to the coarseness or fineness of the
work; for appliqué different coloured cords
are useful, and for most work gold thread or
brown filoselle would be safe. The couching
stitches should be placed fairly close together,
and should be done with strong silken
thread.</p>

<p>When the more solid ornaments are
securely attached to the frontal, the scroll-work
belonging to them may be added as
far as can be reached without interfering
with the tucks in the linen, which may then
be let out.</p>

<p>When the lowest row is finished and the
scroll-work, the fringe is sewn on while the
work is still in the frame, a line being first
drawn (with tailor’s chalk on a dark ground,
or coloured chalk, yellow by preference, on
a white ground) straight along the bottom,
where it will be just covered by the upper
edge of the fringe.</p>

<p>Now the <span class="smcapuc">FRINGE</span> is a feature of the work
to which I would draw particular attention,
because it has a distinct artistic value of its
own, which is too often neglected or not
understood and appreciated as it should be.</p>

<p>The use of a fringe as a decorative finish
to every kind of textile is common to all
countries and all ages. In early Assyrian
sculpture we see it on the garments of
warriors. In the Holy Scriptures we read
of the fringe of golden bells on Aaron’s
ephod, also of the fringes on the garments
of the people of God as symbols of their
consecration; while the fringes at the edges
of rugs and tapestries, both ancient and
modern, are so universal as to simply suggest
their origin—viz. the loose threads of the
warp left when cutting them off the loom.</p>

<p>A handsome fringe is at the same time
the most beautiful and the most natural
finishing touch to the lower edge of any
hanging, whether plain woven or embroidered.
It may also with propriety go
down the sides—though this should be
narrow and preferably uncut.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, 2½ inches is deep
enough for the bottom of the frontal, 1½ inch
for the super-frontal, and ¾ inch for the sides.
In arranging the colours of the fringe a large
proportion should be given to that of the
ground-work, damask, &amp;c., and then a fair
quantity to each of the principal colours used
in the embroidery. Measurements of the
spacing required, and good-sized patterns
of the colours, with a diagram of their order
in the fringe, should always be sent to the
manufacturer when ordering it. The heading
of the fringe should be also specially designed,
or it is nearly certain to be ugly. If gold
thread is used in the embroidery, it should
also appear in the fringe, if not in the ‘fall,’
at least in the ‘head.’</p>

<p>It should first be tacked, then stitched on,
the upper edge just covering the line, starting
from the centre and working towards each
side. It must be stitched firmly with strong
thread or silk of the same colour as one of
those used in the head; the fringe must not
be pulled at all tight from end to end, but
rather ‘eased’ on, or it will ‘draw’ when
taken out of the frame. A few extra inches
should be allowed for this shrinkage when
giving the measurements to the manufacturer.</p>

<p>When this is all done it is ready for the
making up.</p>

<p>Some may consider this mere upholsterer’s
work, and think they may very well, at this
stage, hand it over to the commercial workshop;
but as it is a point of religious as well
as artistic sentiment, that at least the same
guiding spirit, if not actually the same pair
of hands, should see the work through to
the end, we will proceed.</p>

<p>An inner lining of firm, evenly woven
hemp or sail-cloth should be cut exactly true
to the size which the frontal is to be, allowing
2 inches at the bottom to be turned up.
In our supposed case it will be 8 feet long
and 3 feet 6 inches wide. If there are any
creases in it, it should be laid on a wet cloth
and ironed all over with a heavy, hot flat-iron
and not folded again. It is made wide
enough to use without seams. It ought
not to be stiffened with glue, or contain
‘dressing’ of any kind, and should be of
sufficient substance without it. A large
table, or a board that can rest on the
trestles of the mounting frame, should be
covered with a white sheet and the frontal
laid on it, <i>face downward</i>, on taking it out
of the frame. A line ruled down the centre
of the hempen cloth must be placed to the
central line of the frontal, and the two
tacked together, taking care that the needle
does not damage any delicate part of the
embroidery. All knots should be on the
‘right’ side of the frontal if the tacking
threads are to come out afterwards, which
may or may not be necessary; the edges
are then turned evenly, first along the
bottom and then the two sides, beginning
from the bottom when doing each side. It
is then to be turned <i>face uppermost</i>, and the
top edge sewn to the hemp.</p>

<p>The method of hanging the frontal must
now be decided upon. It can be made with
a piece of the linen to go right over the
altar and hang down behind, weighted with
a rod in the hem; or it can be hung by rings
or buttonholes from hooks under the altar-slab.
The former method is the simpler
where there is no gradine with heavy
ornaments to be lifted down every time
the frontal is changed. The super-frontal
(<i>frontlet</i> is perhaps the more correct term)
can then be made in one with the frontal,
as seen in many old examples; but the
latter method seems to be the most common,
possibly from the economical practice of
making one frontlet serve for many frontals.
If then we are making it in this way and
the frontlet is already provided, we must
take two careful measurements—one from
the floor to the hooks on the altar, the other
from the floor to the lower edge of the
frontlet. If the latter is 7 inches deep it
will allow 33 inches of the frontal to <i>show</i>
beneath: the actual height of it will depend
on the position of the hooks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The linen lining is cut to allow turnings
of about an inch down the sides and along
the bottom, and to <i>turn over</i> the top hem
covering the raw edge of the silk on the
right side, where it has been sewn down to
the interlining. The linen lining is now
to be firmly stitched all along with strong
back-stitching; the other edges may be
hemmed round on the ‘wrong’ side after
tacking them in place. A wooden lath may
be slipped through the hem at the bottom,
and a brass one along the top; in this case
buttonholes may be worked in the upper one
wherever the hooks would come, instead of
rings sewn on.</p>

<p>The lining should be of a stout pure linen
and may be of the same colour as the frontal.</p>

<p>I have given somewhat minute directions
as to the making up of the altar-frontal, as
the method is very similar for all this kind
of work. Curtains do not require an interlining,
neither do vestments unless the stuff
is poor, which of course it ought not to be.
An interlining of soft coarse muslin, or very
thin unbleached calico, perhaps helps to keep
it in shape and does not interfere with the
grace of the folds; but anything which makes
a vestment stiff or cumbersome should be
avoided.</p>

<p>Altar-frontals are frequently stretched
and nailed to a light wooden frame—a plan
which is extremely convenient, and perhaps
helps their preservation where they are
frequently changed—but their textile grace
is greatly diminished; when such a frame
is used I would suggest covering it first
with a light-textured linen and <i>sewing</i> the
frontal to this, instead of <i>nailing</i> it on.</p>

<p>If the super-frontal, or frontlet, has not
been already provided, we shall have to
consider the question of the depth it ought
to be made. Again I can only give general
principles. The beauty of the whole depends
on the due proportion of its parts. As
altars are usually nearly of the same height,
whatever their length may be, it follows
that a deep frontlet reduces the proportion
of the frontal to a mere <i>ribbon</i> if it is very
long. Therefore we may say, the longer
the altar the narrower the super-frontal
should be.</p>

<p>That part of the super-frontal which lies
flat on the top of the altar should always be
made of pure linen. It may be of the same
colour as the border which hangs down (if
the fair linen cloth with a cover on it is not
kept on always), but it is really more practical
when made of undyed linen.</p>

<span class="smaller">ON THE COPE AND MITRE</span></h2>

<p>There is no vestment which has engaged
the interest of artists and needlewomen
more than the Cope. It is part of the state
apparel of kings, nobles and bishops, and
seems to be both the ecclesiastical and
secular descendant of the glorious Trabea or
‘Toga picta’ of ancient Rome, where it was
the custom of victorious generals to offer
their magnificent robes in the temples.</p>

<p>It seems to have maintained its pre-eminence
as the most suitable vestment for
priest or bishop at such high and solemn
ceremonies as the Coronation of sovereigns,
choral Baptisms, Marriages and Burials,
also for processions at great festivals, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The old examples which remain are
often extremely beautiful and interesting,
showing that the utmost care and thought
and almost unlimited time must have been
bestowed upon them. They are frequently
embroidered all over, or are made of the
richest velvet or brocade with hood and
orphreys of woven gold.</p>

</div>

<p>The shape is theoretically semicircular,
but in practice it is best, when drawing the
semicircle, to place the centre a few inches
<i>above</i> the straight line which forms the front
edge of the garment (diagram). This
causes the front to be a little longer from
the top to the hem than the back is, and
thus allows for the part which is taken up
at the neck; when it is worn it rises up
there from the shoulders. This becomes
quite ungainly when the orphreys (which
are laid on the edge of the front) are very
wide and stiff, but it again may be partially
compensated by fastening the morse rather
low on the orphreys and having it of a good
size so as to leave a fairly wide opening in
front: the whole cope will then settle lower
on the shoulders. There is another way of
getting over the difficulty, and that is to
‘shape’ it to fit on the shoulders. I have
seen one ancient and one modern specimen
treated thus, and they look very well when
in use, but they are quite exceptional, and
this method of course destroys the typical
half-circle, and would require the orphreys
to be cut to fit also. It is better to keep the
orphreys narrow; the only excuse for such
very wide ones seems to be the magnificent
embroidery of figures and tabernacle-work
with which they were so often decorated in
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, when
wide orphreys became so generally used.</p>

<p class="caption">Sketch showing spacing of Canopy-work—typical English thirteenth-century Cope of
St. Sylvester. Each of the larger spaces is filled with groups of figures illustrating the
Life of Christ, smaller ones with Angels, the medallions with birds.</p>
</div>

<p>A very favourite arrangement of design
in the old English work was to divide the
whole surface of the cope into a series of
quatrefoils, like the ‘Syon cope,’ or of
canopy-work, as shown by the cope of ‘St.
Sylvester,’ enclosing groups of figures illustrating
the life of Christ, the intermediate
spaces being filled with cherubim and angels.
The lowest central space was often occupied
by the Annunciation or the Nativity; the
middle one usually by the Crucifixion, and the
upper one by the Lord in Glory. This arrangement
left very little room for a hood; indeed,
at this period they are generally so small
as not to require much consideration, being
often merely a triangular enlargement of the
orphrey at the centre. When the fashions
changed (which they seemed to do definitely,
if slowly), our forefathers did not exercise
so much judgment as we might expect in
adapting their priceless inheritance of needlework,
but hacked away at one part and
joined on at another, quite regardless of the
mutilation it involved. Even in the Syon
cope the orphreys, which are supposed to
have been added only about fifty years later
than the body of the cope, cut off half of the
figures of the angels nearest to the edge.
The ‘Daroca’ cope at Madrid, which is
worked in the same style and of very similar
design, has its original narrow orphrey, and
the angels are designed to fit into their
spaces, but the large hood seems to have
been an after-thought, and a border and
fringe have been ruthlessly struck through
the figures of four angels enclosing the
upper central group which completed the
design.</p>

<p>In many of the later ones the hood and
orphreys became the principal features of
the cope, and all the decoration was concentrated
upon them. Both hood and
orphrey are worked separately (unless the
former be a quasi-hood joined in with the
orphrey, or marked out merely on the back
of the cope). The orphrey is applied to the
cope in a long embroidery frame, before
making it up. The hood is not usually so
applied, but made up by itself, lined and
fringed; and fastened, by means of loops
sewn on its upper edge, to buttons placed to
correspond on the orphrey (either below or
over it).</p>

<p>The cope and its lining, of silk or linen,
should be cut out exactly alike, allowing at
least half an inch for ‘turnings’ all round
(see <i>A</i> on diagram). Tiny snippets should
be cut out of these ‘turnings’ along the
curved edge (<i>B</i> on diagram), then outside
and lining should have their edges turned up
and tacked separately, then again tacked
together, first down the middle, then along
the straight edge, and lastly round the
curve, in each case starting from the centre.
It is then ready to be slip-stitched together—again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
beginning at the centre, both for
straight and curved edges.</p>

<p class="caption">Mitre of St. Thomas of Canterbury</p>
</div>

<p>The cope is fastened in front with a large
clasp or brooch, called the morse. This
may be made of metal enriched with precious
stones, in which case it is work for the artist-goldsmith.
Or it may be of material richly
embroidered, with or without jewels; a good
size for a morse is from 6 to 8 inches long
by 3 inches wide. Some of those worn by
bishops at King Edward VII.’s coronation
were 12 inches long.</p>

<p>It should be fastened firmly on the right
side of the garment about 12 inches from the
centre, and may have three or four large
strong ‘eyes’ sewn on the other edge in
which the hooks will fit, which are to be
fixed securely on the corresponding spot on
the left side of the cope.</p>

<p>Both the hood and the lower edge of the
cope itself may be finished off with a border
or a fringe, or both.</p>

<p>The Mitre—also part of the official dress
of bishops and archbishops—is a linen cap
of a nearly triangular form as seen from
the front or back. The appearance of it is
familiar to all (in a somewhat exaggerated
form) in the armorial bearings of many Sees,
and in pictures, &amp;c., where towards the
fifteenth century it grows taller and bigger,
and more unbecoming as time goes on.</p>

<p>The older ones are often merely decorated
with an orphrey down the middle and a band
round the head; an embroidered rose or a
jewel is sometimes placed on either side of
the vertical band. In the more ornamental
ones they are completely covered with
embroidery of the finest description, often
jewelled wherever possible—but the same
arrangement is generally followed. The
lappets (<i>infulæ</i>) are worked to match, and
are placed in the middle of the head-band at
the back, either close together or an inch or
two apart. They are from 10 to 14 inches
long and from 1 to 3 inches wide, finished at
the ends with fringe or tassels.</p>

<p>The accompanying illustration of one of
the mitres of St. Thomas of Canterbury shows
an excellent shape, and although well
covered with embroidery is not over-ornamented.
The height is 10 inches and the
size round the head 24 inches.</p>

<p>A mitre is much easier to make than
would at first sight appear.</p>

<p>A simple one of the dimensions of
St. Thomas’s requires a piece of material
12 inches wide and about 26 inches long (of
course, if made for any individual bishop it
must be proportionate to the size of his
head).</p>

<p>It may be made of cloth of gold or any
precious material, or of pure plain white
linen.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/illus38.jpg" width="650" height="325" alt="Diagram showing how to make a mitre" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>To ornament it, the material should be
stretched on a frame, the centre marked,
two lines drawn (tacked in with fine silk)
vertically and horizontally at right angles
to each other, <i>A A</i> and <i>B B</i>. Then marking
off an inch along all the edges for turnings,
a diagonal line is drawn from <i>A</i> to <i>C</i> and
again from <i>C</i> to <i>D</i>.</p>

<p>The parts enclosed within these lines and
<i>D E</i> are where the ornamentation is worked,
including the orphreys. Space for these
should be marked out next, or they may be
worked straight on to the stuff; in any case,
all except the one which covers the seam
should be stitched on before it is taken out
of the frame.</p>

<p>The making up is done simply by stitching
it together in the first place so as to make a
circular band; then the top edges are placed
together, turning in the inch (or whatever is
allowed for). A slit nearly the depth of the
turnings should be cut at <i>C</i> and a snippet cut
out at <i>A</i> (see diagram). It is then to be sewn
neatly together along the top, <i>G</i> meeting <i>G</i>,
with <i>A</i> at one end and <i>D</i> at the other.</p>

<p>When this is done the <i>infulæ</i> are sewn
under the edge of the mitre at the back, and
a lining (previously prepared of exactly the
same shape, but a <i>trifle</i> smaller) slip-stitched
all round the lower edge and kept in place
by means of a few stitches at each point.</p>

<p>The mitre should then be folded quite
flat, and the edge of the folds outlined with
gold twist or fine cord; a little tuft of silk
and gold thread, or a small gold acorn or
some such small ornament, is sometimes
fastened on the apex of each angle.</p>

<p>This is for a simple linen mitre, for the
more gorgeous ones, <i>preciosa</i> and <i>aurifrigiata</i>,
a band of leather is sometimes
placed inside between the outside and the
lining, wide enough to reach from <i>E</i> to <i>B</i>
and <i>C</i> where the angle begins (4 inches in
diagram). The triangular pieces are <i>cut out</i>
before making it up (along the dotted line
in diagram), and another piece of material
(not necessarily like the rest of the mitre) is
cut to fit, and sewn neatly all round, before
the edging of cord is put on. The shape of
this top piece will vary from a square to any
lozenge, according to the angle at which the
point of the mitre is made. In my diagram
it is a right-angle, and so the top would be
8½ inches square. It should have an interlining
of something light, yet fairly stiff.
Parchment used to be considered the correct
thing for this interlining, but a good collar
interlining or tailor’s canvas will suffice.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">ON EUCHARISTIC VESTMENTS, CHALICE-VEIL AND BURSE</span></h2>

<p>The Ornaments Rubric as it stands at the
beginning of our Prayer-books has been an
open field for controversy for many years.
So much light has been thrown by this
means upon customs and observances once
almost forgotten and fallen into neglect
(which obviously at the time of the Rubric
were before the eyes or fresh in the memories
of all Church-people), that we can now once
more picture to ourselves, without effort,
what our forefathers strove successfully to
retain as permissible for the maximum (<i>if
not absolutely commanded as the minimum</i>)
of distinctive vesture and ritual to be used
in the services of the Church of England.</p>

<p>For the Celebrant—the Amice, the Albe,
the Girdle, the Stole, the Maniple or Fanon,
and the Chasuble.</p>

<p>For the Epistoler and Gospeller—the
same vestments, except that instead of the
Chasuble a Dalmatic or Tunicle is worn.</p>

<p>For the Altar itself—a Frontal, Fair linen
cloth, two Corporals (or Corporal and
Chalice-veil, or Corporal and Pall), Purificators,
and Corporal-case or Burse.</p>

<p>The symbolism of the vestments may be
considered in a two-fold aspect: both as
signifying the garments worn by our Lord
at His Passion (and so keeping before the
eyes of the congregation the ‘continual
remembrance’), and, secondly, as representing
the virtues required in the ministers.</p>

<p>Thus we may see in the amice, first, the
cloth with which our Lord was blindfolded
when the Jews struck Him on the face, and,
secondly (as it is first placed on the head),
‘Hope—the Helmet of Salvation.’ In the
albe, first, the white garment in which He
was arrayed by Herod, and secondly, Innocence
of Life, or a ‘conscience void of
offence toward God.’ And so, of the others,
the girdle, stole, and maniple may represent
the cords and bands with which He was
bound and scourged, and, secondly, purity
or chastity, and the yoke of Christ. While
in the chasuble we see the royal robe in
which He was mocked as king, and, secondly,
covering and embracing all, the glorious
grace of charity.</p>

<p>The amice, albe, &amp;c., will be more
particularly described in the chapter on
Linen-work. The altar-frontal we have
already spoken of. In this place we will
consider the stole, maniple, chasuble, and
dalmatic.</p>

<p>In a little book such as this, the primary
intention of which is to be of practical use
to the embroidress, we cannot do more than
touch upon the very outside margin of history.
It is, indeed, extremely interesting to trace
back to their primitive uses and beginnings
all the articles of vesture and ornament used
by the Church in her services; but I can
merely remark in passing upon the evolution
of the Liturgical garments, which seem to
have proceeded gradually from the most
simple and elementary requirements;—begun
by necessity, continued by reverence, and
completed by symbolism.</p>

<p>Putting aside, therefore, learned research
into the origin of the stole (<i>orarium</i>, <i>stola</i>)
and the maniple (<i>mapula</i>, <i>sudarium</i>, <i>mantile</i>,
or <i>fanon</i>), we need not go further back than
the ninth or tenth centuries to find them in
general use by the clergy much the same as
we see them now.</p>

<p>The stole and maniple are usually made
to match, and follow the colour of the season,
as shown by the altar-frontal. About 9 feet
is the full length of the former and 3 feet of
the latter; 2 yards of damask will be sufficient
for both, if the stole has a seam in
the centre, and half the width only of
27-inch damask is required. And the best
shops will supply the half-width if requested
to do so; but if other vestments are being
made at the same time, with the same
material, it is more economical to get all the
silk in one length, as it will cut to more
advantage than by getting the pieces
separately.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. II.—Ancient forms of ends of Stole and Maniple</p>
</div>

<p>The width of a stole and a maniple may
be from 1½ to 2½ inches in the narrowest or
central part. (They are sometimes made
wider, but are not so convenient to wear
under a chasuble.) They may be perfectly
straight from end to end, as in Illustration
<i>A</i>, or they may widen out by degrees from
the centre to the fringe, as at <i>D</i>. They may
have a square end added on like <i>C</i>, or begin
to widen from 8 to 10 inches above the fringe
(see <i>B</i>), or, again, only <i>just</i> over the fringe,
as in <i>E</i> and <i>F</i>. All these are typical ancient
examples.</p>

<p>As to the decoration of them, as a rule
they were either woven in gold thread or
embroidered richly throughout
the whole length in gold diaper
patterns, or geometric devices,
with crosses, roses, &amp;c., at
intervals; or with figures, as
in the celebrated Durham relics
of St. Cuthbert. The fringes
were often very handsome,
either knotted or plain, in
various colours or of gold
alone; sometimes tassels at
the corners were used instead
of fringe, or little golden bells.</p>

<p>The material of which they
are made should be rich and
handsome—by preference the
same as the chasuble. A
deacon’s stole<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> should not be
so richly decorated as that of
the priest.</p>

<p>The chasuble (<i>chesible</i>,
<i>casula</i>, <i>planeta</i>, <i>amphibalus</i>,
<i>pænula</i>) seems in very early
days to have been the ordinary outer dress
of the clergy as well as the one worn at the
celebration of the Eucharist; no doubt the
latter would be handsomer both in material
and ornamentation, so as to make a distinction.
The most usual form would seem to
be that of a semicircle joined up the front,
leaving an aperture sufficient for the head of
the wearer to pass through. It may possibly
have been of a completely circular shape to
begin with, with a hole in the centre like a
poncho or a gaberdine. It may have been
cut away at the sides for convenience, till by
degrees it arrived at the two typical shapes
of ‘Gothic,’ or pointed, and ‘Roman,’ or
square. The former has always been more
generally used in our Church, but the latter
was not uncommon at the time of our Rubric.
Fig. III. shows the early form of Gothic. It
is from one of the tombs in Worcester Cathedral
of the early thirteenth century; there are
numbers of equally fine ones to be seen on
the effigies of priests and bishops in our old
parish and cathedral churches all over the
country; the older they are, the fuller and
softer-looking is the vestment as a rule.
They often have one straight orphrey (or
pillar) in front and a Y-shaped cross at the
back (where the square-shaped ones have a
Latin cross). Sometimes they have a Y-cross
in front also. Occasionally there is no
orphrey in front, as in Fig. III. It is not
unlikely that the orphrey was added to cover
the seam.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">

<p class="caption">Fig. III.—A Bishop’s Tomb in Worcester
Cathedral.</p>
<p class="caption">(<i>Showing old form of English chasuble</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Another and very graceful way of decorating
the chasuble is by embroidering it
over the shoulders between the arms of the
Y-cross, either on the back alone or extending
over the front also. This kind of
ornamentation is called the ‘Flower,’ and
may be seen on the chasuble of St.
Thomas of Canterbury (<a href="#Page_58">p. 58</a>) and also on
Fig. IV.</p>

<p>Almost the only difference between a
modern chasuble of a good ‘make’ and the
old Gothic is the seam on the shoulders,
which makes it less cumbersome to wear.</p>

<p>Although the Gothic may be the more
artistic garment, the square chasuble can
also be a noble-looking vestment in its
older and ampler form, as may be seen by
Fig. I., taken from Rubens’s portrait of
St. Ignatius of Loyola. It also gave scope
for much decoration, as the broad, plain surface,
unbroken by folds, lent itself to more
pictorial treatment. There are many in
the South Kensington and other museums
with representations of the Crucifixion, surrounded
by groups of saints and attendant
angels.</p>

<p>The chasuble follows the colour of the
season. A good average size is 54 inches
long at the back (3 or 4 inches shorter in
front) and 50 inches wide at the widest part.
It takes 6 yards of 25- or 27-inch material,
not counting any extra length which may be
required for ‘repeat’ of pattern, which must
never be forgotten when ordering any kind
of figured stuff. When there are orphreys,
they should be worked separately on strips
of satin, velvet or damask, of a different
colour or material from that of the vestment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and applied to it on a frame before
joining the two halves together at the
shoulders. A medallion may be placed at
the intersection of the Y-cross, which should
not be too low down.</p>

<p>The material of which the orphrey is
made should never be <i>less</i> rich than the
vestment to which it is applied.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapuc">DALMATIC</span> worn by the Gospeller
or deacon and the tunicle worn by the
Epistoler or sub-deacon are very similar to
each other in shape and general appearance.
The latter is usually a little simpler in
decoration.</p>

<p>Many very beautiful examples may be
seen in our museums and picture galleries.
It was a favourite custom with the Old
Masters to represent the Angel Gabriel in
the dress of a deacon in pictures of the
Annunciation. There were also many well-known
ones of SS. Stephen and Lawrence.</p>

<img src="images/illus43.jpg" width="400" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. IV.—Diagram showing dimension
of Chasuble</p>
</div>

<p>The world-renowned ‘Dalmatic of
Charlemagne’<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> is still in existence in the Treasury
of the Vatican, which shows the freedom
with which masters of the craft could treat
the decoration of the dalmatic with the
happiest results. In these days we generally
keep to the two stripes (<i>clavi</i>) and two or
four apparels.</p>

<p>The length of the dalmatic and tunicle
should be about the same as that of the
chasuble or a little shorter. They also
follow the colour of the season where there
are complete suites of vestments, but for
poorer churches it has not always been
considered necessary. The lining of all
vestments should be of a different colour
from the vestment itself. It may be of
either silk or linen; the richer ones are
preferably of silk, as it is not so heavy and
cumbersome as linen. The narrow orphrey
is placed straight down each side of the
dalmatic from the shoulder to the hem,
which may be fringed all round; sometimes
a rich tassel hangs over each shoulder, as in
the sketch of St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>The apparels are rectangular pieces of
silk or velvet, usually embroidered very
richly in gold and colours, and made up
quite separately from the vestment which
they adorn.</p>

<p>They are attached by means of lightly
worked tacking or slip-stitches.</p>

<p>For an amice the apparel is generally
stiffened with an interlining of tailor’s canvas.
It should be about 22 inches long and
3 or 4 inches deep. In use it looks something
like a collar, and is sometimes called
the amice collar. For a dalmatic or tunicle
the apparels may be about 21 × 15 inches
for the skirt and 21 × 9 for the upper one;
but there is no exact rule about size, only
they should not be <i>too long</i> (not more than
21 inches to fit in between the clavi), and
for the skirt not too deep.</p>

<p>They are generally shorter on the albe
than on the dalmatic—from 12 to 15 inches.
They may be of any colour; a crimson
ground with gold, blue, and white decoration
has always been a favourite combination
and looks well with most vestments.
A bold design and plenty of gold and colour
are desirable. Illustrations III. and IV. in
Chapter VI. give good fifteenth or sixteenth
century designs for an apparel. They are
done in these colours. The earlier ones were
generally of geometric design, like the stoles
in Illustration I., and the interlaced circles
with cross in the centre, &amp;c. A piece of
rich brocade or damask, &amp;c., was often used
instead of embroidery.</p>

<p>For sleeves and skirt of albe they may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
match the amice collar. Indeed, I have seen
fourteenth-century work in which the stole,
fanon, orphreys of chasuble, and apparels
of albe and amice are <i>all</i> of the same
pattern, and the effect was very good.</p>

</div>

<p>The corporal-case, or burse, and the silk
chalice-veil are usually <i>en suite</i> with the
altar and vestments. It is said by some
that the silk chalice-veil is a foreign innovation
and has no proper place in the
Anglican ritual, but it is of such general
use now that we must mention it here. It
is usually made of the richest silk or satin,
and embroidered all over, or at the corners
and centre, or with a border all round and
a cross or monogram in the middle of one
side, lined with silk and edged with a narrow
fringe or cord, or made up plain. The design
is frequently, but not necessarily, made to
match the burse. When this is desired, it is
important to arrange it so that the design
and embroidery are not spoilt when the veil
is in use; for it must be remembered that
the burse always presents a flat surface of
at least 9 inches square, while the veil is
intended to <i>hang over the chalice</i>, so that
the centre (with a radius of probably from
2½ to 3½ inches) is the only part that will
lie flat when in use. I once saw a beautifully
worked chalice-veil entirely spoilt by
the heads of the four Evangelists hanging
upside down over the chalice. The design
had apparently been copied from an alms-dish
of Benvenuto Cellini, and was extremely
beautiful in itself and quite suitable for a
burse, but did not lend itself happily to a
chalice-veil.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The burse should be made of rich and
beautiful material. In many of the old ones
the back was made of leather, or something
else useful and strong; but nowadays they
are generally made of damask or satin, the
same as the front. Nine inches square is a
good size. If a chalice-veil and burse are
being made to match, 1 yard of 27-inch
material will usually be enough for the two.
First cut a square of 25 inches for the veil;
then two squares of 11 inches each from the
piece that is left; this allows 1 inch all round
for turnings. When the embroidery on the
silk for the burse is finished it should be
cut out of the frame with the linen still at
the back, not cut away round the work, or
it will be apt to show a ridge where it
leaves off when it is stretched over the
boards; besides, it is needed to protect the
silk where the edge of the boards would
otherwise come in contact with it. Have
ready four pieces of good strong cardboard,
cut exactly square, each 9 inches. This can
be got at any good shop where mounts for
pictures are cut.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. VII.—St. Stephen (after V. Carpaccio)</p>
</div>

<p>Two pieces of fine white linen, each 11
inches square, should be ready, nicely
washed and ironed. The linen is to be
stretched over two of the boards, the embroidered
silk over one, and the plain silk,
for the back, on the other. It can be done
either by taking long stitches from one
edge of the stuff to the other, right across
the boards, or by means of a very small
quantity of embroidery-paste on the inside
of the turnings. Then each linen-covered
board is placed with a silk-covered one,
and the two sewn together with the finest
stitches of over-sewing, in white thread or
silk. After this the linen-faced sides are
placed together, the silk being outside, and
the two sets of board are joined at the left
side by means of four or five tiny hinges,
worked strongly through the silk and inner
lining, in buttonhole stitch of the same colour
as the cover.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. VIII.—St. Lawrence (after Fra Angelico)</p>
</div>

<p>Some people make the back and front
all in one piece of silk, but this is not so
convenient either to work or to make up.
There is more difficulty in getting the design
exactly in the middle and straight on the
boards; there is, besides, a constant strain
afterwards on that edge of the silk which
acts as a hinge every time it is opened and
shut.</p>

<p>Another diversity in the way of making
up a burse is the letting in of side-pieces,
like a purse or pocket-book. This also is
difficult to do neatly, and is inconvenient in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
use; but where it is preferred it may be
made less awkward by setting in a straight-edged
piece of linen instead of a ‘gusset-shaped’
one, covering it with silk like the
burse-cover, and stitching it firmly into a
pleat before joining the two boards together.
It will then more readily keep in place, and
if it bulges when in use it will not look so
slovenly as it does when the side-pieces are
of linen alone. Many of the old burses were
sewn up closely along three sides, with the
fourth only left open, but this is obviously
inconvenient.</p>

<span class="smaller">ON BANNERS, ETC.</span></h2>

<p>Ecclesiastical banners vary to almost any
extent in size, shape, and material, as well as
design.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/illus51.jpg" width="325" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">DESIGN FOR BANNER</p>
</div>

<p>One of the simplest, much in use in the
olden times, was the Banner of St. George,
the patron Saint of England. It is suitable
to nearly every place and occasion, and
consists of a red cross on a white ground,
and is of a plain rectangular shape with a
fringe or border all round.</p>

<p>The choir banner generally has as its
chief ornament the figure of the patron saint,
or the emblems of the dedication of the
church, or the coat-of-arms of the parish or
see, with the name of the church on the
upper border. It may have orphreys down
the sides, or be ‘parsemé’ with flowers, or
the whole of it may be treated more or less
pictorially (within a border) with an incident
in the life of the saint.</p>

<p>The other banners in general use are
those belonging to the different Church
guilds and societies working in the parish,
such as Temperance societies (a favourite
device for this is St. George and the Dragon),
Sunday schools, Missionary societies, ‘C.B.S.’
Embroiderers’ Guilds, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Appliqué work, as I have before observed,
is admirably suitable for banners, whether
the design consists of figures or emblematical
devices. The material should be good of
whatever kind, and strong, and the work
firmly and closely done to stand wear and
tear, especially if used in outdoor processions.
But a painted banner is really more suited to
our climate than a worked one. I do not
mean an <i>imitation</i> of embroidery. Nothing
could be in worse taste than the pretence of
such a thing, but a good painting on canvas
or any suitable material, in oils or tempera,
which will not be greatly affected by sunshine,
rain, or fog, would answer all the
requirements of an outdoor processional
banner far better than a more delicate
embroidered one. After painting I recommend
Inlay, and thirdly Appliqué in suitable
materials for banners. These methods are
described in Chapter VI. But of course for
use in a building ordinary embroidery in
gold and silks is not out of place where
funds permit.</p>

<p>A plain rectangular banner is made up
in the same manner as an altar-frontal. But
a less simple shape is not quite so easy to
finish off neatly. I therefore give a diagram
showing how to arrange the making up of
a more intricate form.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus52.jpg" width="400" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Tackings</p>
<p class="caption">The black lines shew the edge
of Inter-lining. The dotted lines, where
turnings are cut. The fine lines shew the tacking.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The banner is laid face downward on
the table and the interlining (previously cut
exactly to right size and shape) tacked down
to it through the centre and near the edges.
The dotted lines show how the material of
the banner is to be cut to make the turnings
lie flat. It is then to be laid face upwards
and all the edges turned and tacked closely
over the interlining. The outer lining may
then be laid upon it, the corners cut and the
edges turned, making it about one-eighth
inch smaller than the other; the two are then
placed together, tacked once more and then
firmly sewn all round. If the fringe has an
ornamental heading it should be put on last
of all, but if not it should be inserted and
firmly stitched in place before the outer
lining is sewn down. All the edges may be
evenly pressed with a warm iron after the
tacking-threads are removed.</p>

<p>Next to the plain rectangular shape, the
single point at the bottom is the easiest to
make up. Proportion in size and shape is
the great thing to aim at. A square and a
half is a fair one for a rectangle. Variations
should be rather in favour of additional
length than additional width, but no exact
rule can be given, as so much depends on
the design.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that lines
going parallel with the long side tend to
<i>lengthen</i>, and parallel with the short side to
<i>shorten</i>, the apparent size of any figure.</p>

<p>A banner should not be too large and
heavy, in consideration for the person who
has to carry it, neither should it be too small,
or it will look poor and insignificant, however
good both material and workmanship
may be. If possible it should be worked on
both sides, as the expanse of lining which
is displayed when it is in use is not very
interesting to look upon, and is in evidence
for quite as long a time as the front during
a procession. Vasari says that Botticelli
invented the method of work I have described
as <i>Inlay</i> for the use of church banners, considering
it more effective than any other
kind of work and having the advantage of
being equally visible on <i>both sides of the
banner</i>. Botticelli drew beautiful designs
for needlework of this kind, but it had been
actually in use for other purposes many
centuries before.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/illus53.jpg" width="650" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Pall, belonging to the Saddlers’ Company</p>
</div>

<p>Some of the finest specimens of early
English Church embroidery which have
survived to our time are to be seen in the
funeral <span class="smcapuc">PALLS</span> or herse-cloths belonging to
the old guilds and companies. It seems to
me that it would be a good thing if each
parish church had now such a decent and
seemly covering for her departed as was
customary in earlier days.</p>

<p>The pall is still used at the burial of great
persons. Those of us who were present at
the funeral of Queen Victoria will not have
forgotten the beautiful one worked for that
occasion by the ladies of the Royal School of
Art Needlework.</p>

<p>The terrible masses of black velvet, &amp;c.,
used in the last century seem to have left a
sense of recoil in the minds of many against
the use of the pall altogether, but if it were
once realised that black is altogether unnecessary
(white or red or blue and gold
being quite as often used in former times
in the English Church) I think that the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
would be generally approved of having one
beautiful covering for the use of rich and
poor alike.</p>

<p>Of course, it would not be possible or
suitable for every simple parish church to
have such magnificent embroideries as are
shown, for instance, on the illustration here
given of the Saddlers’ Pall, or as the Fishmongers’,
Vintners’, or other rich merchants’
guilds, but a handsome cloth of red or blue
brocade with a text worked on the border,
or a simple symbolic design in appliqué
repeated at intervals, or a plain cross (the
sign which can be read and understood by
all) going over it from side to side and from
end to end, would not be very costly. The
centre of this one is of rich red and gold
velvet brocade, and the border is magnificent
with coloured silks, gold, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Desk-hangings, which are of use for the
better preservation of the books laid upon
them, and sometimes desirable as introducing
a little colour and comfort among the
wood and stone-work of pulpit or reading-desk,
are usually, though not necessarily,
of the same colour as the altar-frontal or
other hangings, so far as the ground-work
is concerned; the embroidery also ought to
harmonise in colour and style,
especially if they come into view
at the same time. The same
may be said of almsbags, book-markers,
kneelers, and any other
textile furnishings there may be.</p>

<p>For a desk, a piece of silk or
velvet, &amp;c., should be measured
wide enough to cover the flat
part of the desk (allowing a little
extra on each side for ‘turnings’),
and the length should be sufficient
to hang down about 12 to 16
inches in <i>front</i> only of a pulpit
desk, but both <i>back</i> and <i>front</i>
of a faldstool or prayer desk:
6 to 8 inches is deep enough
for these, which should be embroidered
and fringed both front
and back. A simple border-pattern
either upright or lateral
in motive looks as well as anything
here, as it is not intended
to attract particular attention to
itself.</p>

<p>Altar and office-books may
be covered with very beautiful
embroideries, and if the materials
of which they are made are good
and substantial they will stand a
fair amount of wear and last many
years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Almsbags</span> should not be very
elaborately worked, as they soon
wear out or yet dirty when in constant use.
Three-eighths of a yard of twenty-four inch
material is enough to cut two if arranged in
the manner shown on the diagram, thus:—</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the back of each
bag <i>A</i>, is cut in one piece and the front,
<i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, is cut in two pieces. The interlining,
which should be of a good quality of tailor’s
canvas, is cut in the same way; the silk or
linen lining—the ‘business’ part of the bag—is
made a <i>very little</i> smaller than the
worked part of the front <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>To make up the almsbag, after the
embroidery is worked on the silk (or whatever
the material may be), the linen at the
back may be cut away round the work if
it makes it too clumsy. Then interlining
and embroidered front are tacked together,
corners cut and curves nicked before turning
the edges over, the upper part of front and
the whole back treated in the same way.</p>

<p>Then the stout silk or fine linen lining
is joined along the sides and bottom with
fine back-stitching, and the upper edge
hemmed down to the top of embroidered
front and along the dotted line of upper
front (see <i>D</i>).</p>

<p>Kneelers frequently consist merely of
mats and strips of carpet, and certainly
from an artistic point of view good carpet
is better than poor needlework. But if
people will have the patience to do it
there is no need to have bad needlework
when there is an ideal stitch for the purpose
which requires no technical skill in
embroidery—which calls in fact for nothing
in the worker but diligence, patience, and
accuracy in counting. I refer to the good
old cross-stitch, which unfortunately has
got itself into disrepute by its devotees
trying to make it do work for which it is
manifestly by its nature unfit, and by the
crude colouring which was common at the
time the so-called Berlin-work was in vogue.</p>

<p>If we return to the early pattern-books of
German and Venetian origin (there
are many republished in the present
day) it should be quite easy to
choose good and suitable ones from
among them, avoiding as a rule
those sold in shops as ‘exclusively
ecclesiastical,’ which are generally
hideous, and also any that make
attempts at shading naturalistic
foliage and blossom: see that the
design frankly acknowledges the
limitations of the method and thus
makes artistic use of it (see Illustration
<i>F</i>, Chapter XII.). Good strong
wool or silk and linen canvas should
be selected and the work done with
a ‘rug’ needle.</p>

<p>This work is easily made up, the
edges turned over and strong flax
or hempen cloth hemmed to it. An
interlining of coarse felt may be
added if extra thickness is desired.</p>

<p>The modern use of the <span class="smcapuc">BOOK-MARKER</span>
in the Holy Bible, Office,
and Altar books seems partly to be
occasioned by the absence of illuminated
Initials, Versals, &amp;c., which
in former days assisted the reader
in finding his place in the book.
But there was often in medieval
times a small handkerchief (<i>sudariolum</i>)
attached to the altar-book
by a ribbon for the use of the
officiating priest, and this string
would naturally sometimes be used
as a ‘marker.’ In the course of
time, like all other things used in the
sanctuary, this would become resplendent
with gold and embroidery, till the ornamental
took the place of the useful and remained
only as a symbol.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Book-markers should not be wide or
clumsy or they defeat one of the objects
for which they exist—the preservation from
wear and tear of the books in which they
are placed. It would perhaps be more convenient
if they were fastened into the binding,
but as this is seldom done effectually in the
first place, and they soon get worn out, the
movable ones, which can easily be replaced,
are now in general use. A simple device
at each end and the appropriate finish of a
good fringe are all that is necessary. For
the sake of harmonious appearance, and not
for any ritual reason, they are usually made
<i>en suite</i> with the vestments and altar.</p>

<p>When working book-markers sufficient
ribbon should be left below the design to
turn up and cover the back of the work.
The raw edge will be turned in and it will
be slip-stitched along the top and over-sewn
down both sides. The fringe is then over-sewn
to the extreme end of the marker. If
the ‘head’ of the fringe is not suitable for
this treatment, the ribbon that covers the
back of the work may be cut separately and
the head of the fringe inserted between the
two. The back may also be embroidered.</p>

<span class="smaller">ON THE PRINCIPAL STITCHES USED IN LINEN-WORK</span></h2>

<p>In all the previous chapters I have assumed
that the embroidress would carry out the
suggestions given by means of gold and
silver thread, floss silks, &amp;c., working them
either directly upon some rich fabric such
as silk or velvet, or else on linen with the
ultimate purpose of transferring it to the
more precious material, or, thirdly, on a
linen ground which is eventually covered so
entirely with embroidery that no trace of
the original material appears. I have mentioned
coloured linens and linen thread as
desirable materials where economy is a consideration,
to be used for the same purposes
and in the same manner as silk and
gold, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I now propose to treat of linen-work as
a separate branch of Church needlework,
different both in regard to the materials
employed and in the method of using them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">
<img src="images/illus59.jpg" width="475" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Sampler for Linen-work</p>
</div>

<p>To begin with, as the ground-work will
be of <i>white</i> linen, which naturally requires
frequent washing, the decoration of it must
either be detachable (as in the case of ‘Apparels’),
or it must be of such a nature as to
withstand injury under the necessary processes
of the laundry.</p>

<p>This limits the materials for the embroidery
to linen thread, cotton, crewel wool,
washing silk, and a certain make of tambour
gold which can be conveniently worked
through the substance of the linen.</p>

<p>It excludes (generally speaking) all loose
surface-stitches and highly raised relief
work; but on the other hand it allows of
many curious and diversified stitches which
can only be worked satisfactorily when done
in the hand without a frame, such as chain-stitch,
buttonhole, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>In choosing the materials, whether it be
the linen itself or the embroidery threads, a
careful judgment is required to select only
the best and most durable. If colours are
to be used in the ornament, it is well to test
them beforehand as to their behaviour under
the ordeal of washing. The guarantee of
the labels on many of them is insufficient.
The linen itself ought also to be washed
in boiling water before the cutting-out or
embroidering is attempted. Hand-made and
grass-bleached linens are much to be preferred
to the more perfect-looking but less
reliable products of machinery.</p>

<p>Linen thread for embroidery is not so
easy to work with as some of the cottons
prepared for this purpose; but it looks so
well when carefully handled that it repays
a little extra trouble in the using. It is apt
to come untwisted in the friction through
the stuff, and then to break rather readily;
the remedy is to roll the needle between the
finger and thumb from time to time during
each needleful, to keep it twisted right, or to
change hands, working with the left if
possible, or from the opposite end of the
work where it is convenient. The needlefuls
also should not be too long.</p>

<p>‘D.M.C.’ cottons (of which there are a
great number of different kinds) are very
nice-looking and pleasant to work with; the
colours also are good.</p>

<p>For white work I prefer Clark’s Anchor
(<i>à broder</i>), the numbers from 5 to 10 being
especially good and useful.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Stitches</span></h3>

<p>There is a great variety in the stitches
which may be employed in linen embroidery,
but for each separate piece of work it is best
to keep to one or two only. In the accompanying
sampler I have contrived to show
about a dozen different ones without seriously
interfering with the unity of the design; but
it is to be taken merely as a sampler of
stitches, and of those only the most desirable
for Church linen.</p>

<p>All this kind of work should be solid and
firm without being drawn too tight. It
should never be so tightly done as embroidery
which is worked in a frame, if the
linen becomes puckered or drawn out of
shape it will never ‘come right’ afterwards,
so the stitches ought to be well practised on
a waste piece of linen till the right degree
of tension is ascertained. A want of due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
regard to this is the cause of much disappointment
in work done in the hand; if too
loose it soon becomes shabby, and if too
tight it makes a series of small holes all
round the work, after
repeated efforts of the
laundress to make the
thing lie smoothly
by means of much
stretching and heavy
ironing.</p>

<p>In general method,
embroidery worked
loose in the hand
differs from that done in a frame, in that
each stitch is completed by one action of the
needle instead of two, as it goes in and out
of the stuff.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus60.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="Diagram A" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Satin-stitch</span>, marked <i>A</i> on the sampler,
is nearly always padded first by running a
few stitches backwards and forwards in the
opposite direction to that of the satin-stitch,
which covers it by going ‘over and over,’
the needle going in at one edge of the outline
and coming out at the other as nearly
as possible at right angles. The stitches
should be placed quite close together, and
should never be <i>much</i> more than ¼ inch
across: if the design shows a wider space
to be filled it must be subdivided by a voided
line. Some workers pad their satin-stitch
very thickly, thinking to make it handsomer;
but all very high relief is a mistake from an
artistic point of view, as it destroys the
delicacy one expects to see in linen-work,
and obtrudes itself unduly even when worked
entirely in white. Indeed, some authorities
go so far as to say that the change of surface
or texture caused by the stitchery is the
only legitimate effect in white work; but I
think the majority would allow a <i>little</i> relief,
providing it is not exaggerated, especially as
it causes the satin-stitch to lie much more
smoothly than when done without any under
layer of cotton.</p>

<p>Next to the satin- and chain-stitches I
think <span class="smcapuc">BUTTONHOLE-STITCH</span> is perhaps the
most useful for linen embroidery. Simple
buttonholing is worked from left to right,
setting the needle in and out at right angles
to the outline, holding the thread down with
the left thumb at each stitch while the needle
goes over it. Both chain- and feather-stitch
may be considered variations of buttonhole,
the principle of the method being the same
in each case, viz. working from left to right
(or from the top downwards), holding the
thread under the thumb for the needle to
pass over as it pierces the stuff and comes
out again at one ‘stroke.’</p>

<p>In ordinary buttonholing the stitches are
placed as near together as possible: at a
little distance apart it becomes ‘blanket-stitch,’
of which there are as many variations
as the ingenious needlewoman chooses to
make, but which are not appropriate to our
present purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus61.jpg" width="500" height="125" alt="Diagram B" />
</div>

<p>To work the foliation marked <i>B</i> on the
sampler, it should be slightly padded, exactly
as for satin-stitch, and the ridged side of the
stitch kept to the outline; round the inner
curves, if a sufficient number of stitches are
inserted, the ridge will stand up a little and
accentuate the ‘eye’ of the curve very
prettily. The firmness of outline obtained
by buttonholing has caused it to be applied
to the most beautiful designs for cut-linen
work (see Illustration, <a href="#Page_82">p. 82</a>), which may be
carried out with any amount of detail without
the least danger of its fraying or getting out of
shape, and which will last and wear as long
as the linen itself. The outline should be
run round before working the buttonhole for
this purpose, the stitches kept close together
and drawn rather tighter than when intended
to lie on the surface.</p>

<p>The inner outlines, also marked <i>B</i> on the
sampler, are done in the same stitch, in
the one case set in straight and in the other
slanting. The tiny rosettes above are worked
by setting the needle in at the same place
at each stitch. By drawing the thread fairly
tight, a small neat hole is arrived at in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
centre of each; if the linen is very hard and
strong, the spot should be pierced with
a stiletto before working.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus62.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Diagram C" />
</div>

<p>Another application of the principle is
shown as a ‘filling’ stitch at <i>C</i> on the
sampler. It is worked like one of the lace
stitches, except that the needle takes up a
bit of the linen beneath at each stroke
(instead of ‘being in the air,’ as lace may be
truly defined). An outline of chain-stitch
should be worked first, as it provides a neat
and convenient boundary for the rows of
buttonholing to begin and end with. Bringing
out the needle on the edge to the right
of the worker, it is carried straight across
the work to the left and set into one of the
chain-stitches there; it is then brought out
at the next chain, and the long thread buttonholed
over till it arrives at the beginning of
the thread where it was fastened on. The
same process is repeated till the space is
filled, the stitches in each row of buttonholing
being placed between those of the
previous row, and each row beginning at the
left over the thread laid across from the right.</p>

<p>This will be seen clearly by the detail <i>C</i>,
which is very much enlarged to show the
working, but the rows of buttonholing are
not usually much more than ⅟₁₆ of an inch
deep. It combines admirably with chain-stitch
for leaves, flowers, and even figures,
the stems and small details being worked in
chain, and the filling in this solid form of
buttonhole, while features and the folds of
garments may be clearly indicated by voided
lines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feather-stitch</span>, marked <i>D</i> on the sampler,
may be considered another development
of the buttonhole-stitch, the simpler forms of
it being merely one, two, or three slanting
buttonhole-stitches taken alternately from
the one side and the other of imaginary
boundary lines. In practising the stitch,
until the worker gets accustomed to it, it is
a good plan to trace real boundary lines,
determining the width to be kept to, and
two other lines at equal distances within
these, as a guide for keeping the stitches all
of the same size.</p>

<p>Feather-stitch by itself makes a very
pretty border pattern, but it always seems
a little frivolous unless it is subdued by an
enclosing line of chain-stitch or buttonhole,
with either of which it will combine most
happily. The chain may be done first on
each side (making, in fact, the boundary for
width), and then the single feather-stitches
taken from side to side into each chain in
turn, being careful to pick up a tiny bit of the
stuff on the needle, as well as the thread of
the chain, at each stitch, otherwise it will be
only a surface-stitch, which does not wear
so well, though the appearance is almost
exactly the same. If buttonhole be used for
the edge, either it should be done <i>slanting</i>,
to agree with the feather, or the latter should
be worked in <i>upright</i> stitches to suit the
buttonhole. In this case it does not matter
which is done first, as the stitches go <i>between</i>
and not <i>into</i> each other.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/illus63.jpg" width="150" height="400" alt="Diagram D" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Herring-bone</span> is somewhat similar in
appearance to feather-stitch, but the method
of working is quite different. It is begun
from the opposite end of the border, working
from the bottom upwards, and the needle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
is set in the same direction as the line of the
border, not at right angles or diagonally,
but on the line itself. The stitches are taken
alternately from side to side, and the threads
cross each other naturally, without any
intervention of the needle or thumb of the
worker. It is a stitch well known to the
neat-fingered housewife for keeping flat the
cut edges of a seam where a hem is considered
too clumsy. As a decoration it is
seldom used in its simplest form; but I have
seen many beautiful pieces of embroidery
executed entirely in other forms of the same
stitch, such as Swiss or Close herring-bone
or Fish-bone. The method of work is shown
here, and I think needs no further description.
In the third diagram of this stitch it will be
noticed that the needle goes at right angles
with the outline, both in the large stitch from
edge to edge, and in the little stitch in the
middle. This makes the work less thick and
substantial than the Swiss, which gives the
same effect at a greater expenditure of silk
or cotton, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/illus64.jpg" width="650" height="400" alt="Diagram E" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Back-stitching</span> is very useful for making
fine lines, for following outside of an outline
which may seem too hard, or for breaking up
a background, as in the central petal of the
<i>fleur-de-lys</i> in the sampler, where it answers
the same purpose as dots or ‘sympathetic
lines’ in a drawing, by filling a flat surface
quietly and unobtrusively. It is well to work
it in rather coarser thread than the satin-stitch
it accompanies. The stitches should not lie
too close together; a <i>very</i> small piece of the
stuff should be taken up on the needle at each
stitch, and the point of the needle brought
out at the spot where the next stitch is to be.
If the dots do not look large enough, each
stitch should be gone over <i>twice</i>, instead of
only once, at exactly the same place. When
three or four stitches are used one over the
other, they make a smooth raised knot
preferable to French knots for linen-work, as
they do not get disarranged by ironing.
When only one or two stitches are used for
each dot, the needle should pierce the thread
at the back as it goes through from one dot
to the next place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cross-stitch</span> is, I think, too well known
to need much in the way of description.
But the application of it to <i>linen-work</i> would
well repay more attention than is commonly
given to it. I need only point to the
accompanying examples from South Kensington
to show something of the beauty
that may be arrived at by this simple kind
of work. There are three typical ways of
doing this, the first (as in Illustration <i>F</i>) by
making a pattern <i>on the linen</i> by means of
<i>cross-stitch</i> alone, in one colour. The second
(<i>F, f</i>), by making the pattern <i>by the linen</i>,
the background being in cross-stitch. The
third, by <i>combining</i> cross-stitch with back-stitch
for the fine lines, by means of which
the smaller detail can be described without
breaking up the pattern too much. (See
<i>F, f</i>).</p>

<p>It can be diversified by using two or
more colours, but a medley is undesirable.
I myself prefer the patterns worked in one
colour only; and I believe most of the old
work was done in either red, green, blue,
or brownish yellow, each used alone, and
making by itself quite sufficient contrast
with the white linen on which it was
worked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>If the linen used is too fine to allow the
counting of the threads, in order to keep the
stitches of a uniform size and to follow the
pattern correctly, a fine canvas may be
tacked over it, and the work done through
the two thicknesses. When it is finished,
the threads of the canvas can easily be
drawn away, leaving the work on the linen
sufficiently accurate if it has been carefully
done. I would recommend the use of an
embroidery frame for work done on this
system, as the stitches ought to be set in
quite vertically to keep them true. All
canvas or ‘cushion’ work may be done on
other textiles by means of this method,
and for quite coarse work a frame is unnecessary.</p>

<p>There is yet another application of cross-stitch
admirable for linen-work, which was
much in favour for the bordering of corporals,
&amp;c., in the sixteenth century, and
presents a lighter effect than the ordinary
solid-looking cross-stitch. In appearance it
is very similar to ‘Lacis’ (a darning on
coarse, square-meshed net, or on small-meshed
netting). This open-worked cross-stitch
is accomplished by drawing the thread
it is worked with quite tight at each half-stitch
that is taken into the linen, the <i>first
process</i> of the ‘cross’-stitch is worked all
along one row before the second, which
‘crosses’ over it. It is either worked in two
colours, one for the pattern and one for the
ground, or the ground alone is worked,
leaving the linen to form the pattern, in the
same manner as <i>F, f</i>, the ground of the
border becoming open-work. It may be
thus worked with a beautiful lacy effect
in white thread or silk for altar-linen. In
each case the thread used must be fine and
strong.</p>

flowers red, white and blue. The stitch
used throughout is close herring-bone or
braid-stitch, with the exception of the quaint
little birds, which are done in cross-stitch.</p>

<p>For less elaborate work one of the cross-stitch
borders <i>F</i> and <i>F, f,</i> <a href="#Page_77">p. 77</a>, and worked
in red silk or in gold colour, would look well,
and all the rest of the altar-linen could
be done to match, or with a narrower
border.</p>

<p>For white work Illustration II. is very
satisfactory. The outline of the leaves may
be done in chain-stitch, the veins and grapes
in satin-stitch, the quatrefoil in feather-stitch;
the sacred monogram may be either
solid satin-stitch, divided down the middle
of each down-stroke by a voided line, or
outlined with chain-stitch and filled with the
buttonhole filling or with satin-stitch dots,
or again, with close feather-stitch like the
quatrefoil. The stems of the vine may be
filled in the same manner, and the leaves
with a series of back-stitches, like the illustration
given for Chalice-veil.</p>

<p>A neatly sewn hem is better for altar-linen
than hem-stitching or drawn thread;
the latter especially being somewhat flimsy,
and destroying to a certain extent the
wearing properties of the fabric, is decidedly
unsuitable for this purpose, except perhaps
one kind, of which I give an illustration
here (Illustration III., <a href="#Page_81">p. 81</a>).</p>

<p>In this some of the strands of either warp
or weft are withdrawn as in ordinary drawn-thread
work, but instead of being merely
tied together by means of the needle and
thread, or the spaces between filled up with
stitches, the absent strands are replaced,
and one might say <i>more</i> than made good by
the darning which builds up the pattern.</p>

<p>This darning might be done all in white-linen
thread, or colour may be introduced as
in this example, which is of blue and white
alternate medallions, and the fringe is spaced
with blue to correspond.</p>

<p>The threads withdrawn should be counted
if the linen is fairly coarse, but if very fine,
measurement will suffice for accuracy and
is not so trying for the eyes; indeed, after a
little practice, neither should be necessary
in the case of the strands taken up by the
needle in the course of the work. In my
example—which is done on a heavy homespun
linen—twenty-four threads go to the
half-inch, both in warp and weft, and I
would recommend that this pattern should
be practised on nothing finer until it is
thoroughly learnt, as it is somewhat intricate.
The narrow border above and below
the principal pattern is simple enough.</p>

<p>To work it, begin by drawing three-eighths
of an inch deep, then threading a
needle with blue linen, silk or cotton, take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
up five threads (or their equivalent one-eighth
of an inch), and knot the blue over
them with a single knot, just to keep it in
place to start with; lay the end along with
the strands of the linen, and work over it
by taking an equal number of strands on
the needle in the opposite direction to the
first lot. This must be done backwards and
forwards till nearly half the bar is firmly
and evenly covered with blue. Then take
up five and leave five, darning (over twenty
altogether) backwards and forwards about
four times to make the cross-bar. The first
bar is to be continued up to the end, then
the other stroke of the H-form is to be
worked the same as the first, only, instead
of doing the cross-bar, the needle is just
run through the former stitches (in with the
warp-strands). They are worked alternately
two blue and two white, and I strongly
recommend blue or green to be used with
the white for practice, for the sake of the
worker’s eyes, as all white work is undeniably
bad to do very much of.</p>

<p>To fasten off the thread it is simply run
through the stitches already done and cut
off close.</p>

<p>To work the larger part of the pattern,
threads are drawn to the depth of one inch
(see <i>A</i>, on Illustration IV., which is very
much enlarged to show the method of
work). This will be for a row of half
medallions. A very fine needle and No. 100
or 120 cotton is used to collect the strands
into a series of upright bars (<i>B</i>), by twisting
the fine cotton over each group of four (or
an eighth part of the threads which each
medallion takes to do). It should be twisted
round and round fairly tightly, from one end
to the other, and a few stitches into the
linen will help to keep them apart at each
end. When this is done, another inch may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
drawn, leaving a few threads of the linen
intact between the two halves of the
medallion, <i>D</i>.</p>

<p>The dotted lines at <i>E</i> show how the bars
are pulled apart on the one hand and drawn
together on the other by the darning forming
the pattern, the bars thus connecting the
whole of the medallions throughout the
work. <i>F</i> shows one of the latter being
worked from the centre. It is begun by
darning eight bars regularly backwards and
forwards about four times. Then the two
middle bars are left and one side is darned
over only three bars, to finish the first
‘step,’ and to leave the little window-like
opening, <i>H</i>, then over two bars only to
finish the ‘window,’ and begin the second
step. At <i>J</i> it goes right across six bars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
once, when returning to the centre it goes
down the two that were left till it arrives
near <i>F</i> again, and the other side is begun in
steps like the first. At <i>J</i> it goes right across
six again and keeps on till the second step is
finished, which is where the needle has got
to in the sketch. The second step is about
half the depth of the first. The third is the
same depth as the second, but is darned over
four bars. This leaves two to be finished
last, and these two are darned over till the
undrawn strip of linen is reached and the
half medallion is finished. The other half is
exactly the same, only reversed. The thread
should be worked fairly tight throughout.</p>

<img src="images/illus71.jpg" width="425" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. IV.—Details of Fig. III, showing how
to work it</p>
</div>

<p>The hem at the bottom should be
finished off with a fringe. If colours
are used in the work they should
appear again in the fringe, but if it
is all white a good knotted one of fine
white linen thread should be sewn on
by its upper edge (see Illustration II.),
taking care not to stretch it at all, but
rather to ease it on. It should hang
quite free, not on the stuff, as it is in
the case of frontals, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I may here remark that it is a mistake
to suppose that there is any difficulty
in washing fringes. If they are
not too deep in the ‘fall,’ and are well
made of good linen thread, they only
need to be well shaken two or three
times when wet and while drying, to
make them hang perfectly straight and
well.</p>

<p>Good thread lace<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> may be used instead
of fringe. Lace is also sometimes
tacked along the front to hang
over the super-frontal, but as it requires
to be taken off every time the cloth
is washed it is not practicable unless
some careful lady is responsible for its
welfare, or unless some such lace as
Irish crochet be used, which will stand
washing.</p>

<p>I believe the coloured embroidery described
above used to be tacked on to the
ends of the fair linen in this way like
apparels, and removed for the more frequent
washing of the cloth itself; in some
modern churches where there are plenty of
persons able and willing to attend to these
things they are still used, and quite appropriately;
but for a small village or very
poor town church it seems more suitable to
have good strong linen, simple embroideries
(either in one colour or white), and a stout
linen fringe to match.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. V.—Design for Cut-linen work</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Cut-linen too may be used either for an
open-work border or instead of lace or fringe
for the edge. If evenly and firmly worked,
either in buttonhole or over-sewing, it will
last as long as the linen itself.</p>

<p>In olden times the <span class="smcapuc">CORPORAL</span> or corporax-cloth
was often made large enough to
cover the surface of the altar, to fold over
the chalice, or a ‘Pair of Corporals’ were
used. It seems to be more general now
to have one corporal about twenty-four
inches square, and one smaller and thinner—a
‘Chalice-veil,’ used in conjunction with
a stiffened square of linen called the pall;
which together take the place of the second
corporal.</p>

<p>The corporal may be worked with five
crosses like the altar cloth, only smaller, or
with one, just above the hem, in the centre
of one of the sides; or it may have a border
embroidered all round it. There are some
in the Victoria and Albert Museum done in
cross-stitch very similar to the designs I
have suggested for Fair Linen Cloths, and
one, it may be noted, with the border worked
exactly the same on both sides (inside and
out), so that when turned over in actual use
there would be no ‘wrong side’ to show.</p>

<p>The more delicate ‘Chalice-veil’ may be
embroidered all over, so long as the decoration
does not interfere with the softness
of the linen, which is its chief beauty. If it
is intended to be folded when in use it should
not be so soft, and the design might take up
just one-ninth of the surface—one-third of
the width by one-third of the length, so that
when folded in three each way the ornamentation
may fill the central square.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. VII.—Design for centre of Chalice-veil</p>
</div>

<p>If it is to hang over as a veil the same
rule applies to it as to the silk chalice-veil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
namely, that as one-third of it will hang
down all round when in use, the design must
take account of these conditions. The
corners or the sides may be the centre of
decoration, which should in this case grow
upward, or a border may run all round. It
is frequently edged with lace of the finest
and richest description.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapuc">PALL</span>, which is used with the soft
fine chalice-veil, is a stiff square of linen
from 4 to 6 inches in size, according to the
chalice it is to cover. It may be embroidered
all over, or with a cross, or the sacred monogram,
or a symbol of the Passion in the
centre. Some stiffen it with a square of
cardboard covered with linen, others with a
double fold of the material used for the
interlining of linen collars. The upper
square, which is embroidered, is often made
separately; it is in this case hemmed (sometimes
edged with a narrow thread lace), and
a tiny strap is buttonholed across each corner
to keep it in place. Otherwise it is over-sewn
finely all round in the same manner as are
the boards of a burse. In every case the
stiffening is covered on both sides with fine
white linen neatly sewn.</p>

<p>The origin of the <span class="smcapuc">PURIFICATOR</span> is very
obscure, while the use of and the necessity
for it are quite obvious.</p>

<p>Purificators and lavabo towels now supply
the place of the original maniple, &amp;c., and
in consequence are not subject to much
ornamentation, the cross on the purificator
being intended more to indicate its sacred
use than as a decoration. There seems to
be no reason why the lavabo towel should
not have a neat border worked just above
the hem or fringe.</p>

<p>Purificators should be made of the softest
of linen, plain or diapered, about 12 inches
square, or 9 × 12. The edges may be fringed
by drawing out threads all round to the
depth of about half an inch, or they may be
neatly sewn with a very narrow plain hem.
A small cross in the centre or at one of the
corners is all that is necessary in the way of
embroidery.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapuc">CREDENCE CLOTH</span> should be made to
fit the table. It may hang down a little on
each side like the altar cloth, and have a
border somewhat similar only narrower, and
either a fringe or lace to match in style.</p>

<p>In some churches the old custom is
retained of hanging a ‘<span class="smcapuc">HOUSELING-CLOTH</span>’<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
over the altar-rails. These rails were first
required in England about the beginning
of the seventeenth century, according to
Canon 7 of 1640, to preserve the communion-table
from Puritan profanations.</p>

<p>Previously to this the Houseling-cloth
(a long white silken or linen towel) was
held before the communicants as they knelt
at the altar. It is a reverent and seemly
custom, intended to prevent the fall of any
particle of the Blessed Sacrament during
the communion of the people.</p>

<p>The decoration of it may be treated in
the same style as that of the altar- and
credence-cloths.</p>

<p>Humeral veils, offertory veils, and
sudaries of various kinds have been in
more or less constant use to preserve the
books, sacred vessels, vestments, &amp;c., from
contact with the bare hands of the assistants
at the altar. It is to this reverent care
and scrupulous cleanliness that we owe the
conservation of so many of the precious
relics of the past that have come down to
our own time, which with rough and careless
handling would have perished long ago.
A small neat cushion of velvet or some
other soft textile, about 9 by 3 inches in
size, after the old fashion, would be much
better for the altar-book to rest upon than
the hard wooden or brass desks we so often
see nowadays. Wherever these latter are
used a soft cloth of some kind should at least
prevent their contact with valuable books,
especially if the covers are embroidered.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">ON THE ALBE, SURPLICE, ETC.</span></h2>

<p>There are various opinions among the learned
both as to the origin and line of descent (so
to speak) of all the distinctive vestments worn
by the ministers of the Church at the present
day. The albe and surplice are not among
the least interesting from an historical point
of view; however, it is not our purpose to
discuss it here, and whatever theory we may
prefer—that which derives them from a
Levitical ancestry, or from the Eastern
garments of common use in the time of Our
Lord, or from the Græco-Roman in the early
centuries of our era, the fact remains that
from the very earliest times of which we
have any record of such things <i>white linen
raiment</i><a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> was a noticeable feature in the dress
of the Christian minister, whether priest,
deacon, or server.</p>

<p>The albe and the surplice were <i>possibly</i>
both derived from one original garment.
Their chief characteristics were that they
were long, full, and made with sleeves;
moreover that they were usually of white
linen, and either quite plain or ornamented
in some simple and appropriate manner by
a border that could be washed with the
garment, or (in the case of the albe from the
thirteenth century) by apparels which were
easily removed without injuring it.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Albe</span> has retained its primitive
character in all these respects.</p>

<p>The long flowing garment is confined at
the waist, for convenience in ministration,
by a girdle or band, which may consist
simply of a plain linen cord 4 yards long,
finished at the ends with tassels of the same;
or it may be a band from 1 to 3 inches wide,
richly embroidered in silk and gold. When
this is the case it should be fastened by
strings sewn to the lining, or by hooks and
eyes, or a clasp, so that it may not become
creased and spoiled by frequent tying. A
band is perhaps better for keeping the stole
in place as being less liable to roughen and
damage the silk. It seems to have been an
old English custom to use a band, judging
by the old inventories, &amp;c.,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> but it is not so
general in these days as the cord, and the
symbolism is lost unless the band is kept
quite narrow.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. II.—Ancient Albe</p>
<p class="caption">(<i>South Kensington Museum</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The diagram (Illustration II.) shows the
shape and dimensions of a very old albe now
in the Victoria and Albert Museum, South
Kensington. The linen it is made of is 22
inches wide, and the seams are joined down
the middle of the front and back by means
of an insertion, worked in buttonhole-stitch
with white linen thread, rather more than;
¼ inch wide. The seams at the shoulders are
treated in the same way with insertion ½ inch
wide, into which is worked an inscription
in red thread; and there is a small red cross
on each of the gussets let in at the waist to
contain the gathers, which are set very close
together, to provide the necessary fulness
for the skirt.</p>

<p>The apparels are made of fourteenth
century brocade.</p>

<p>Modern albes are usually either gathered
into a neck-band somewhat like a surplice
(see Illustration III.), and so are full all the
way down, or they may be widened gradually
from the shoulder.</p>

<p>The measurements are very similar in
each case, and take from 7 to 9 yards of
linen, a yard wide.</p>

<p>In the gathered pattern (which is much
handsomer than the plain one) there are
no <i>cut</i> seams except for the sleeves; the
selvedges should be over-sewn together with
fine cotton very closely, and then the seams
will not show at all. Those on the sleeve
should be finely stitched and the raw edge
turned in and ‘felled’—i.e. <i>hemmed</i>—down
on the inside. The neck and shoulder bands
should be stitched with fine back-stitching
on the outside. They may be decorated
with any fancy stitch as well, or a narrow
border may be embroidered. The hem
round the bottom should be from 1 to 3
inches deep. A border of embroidery may
be worked all round, above the hem.</p>

<p>The custom of working a lace insertion
in the middle of a seam, which used to be
common to the better sort of household linen
as well as that for the Church, has fallen
into disuse of late years, in consequence of
our linen being woven so much wider than
it used to be. But it might still be used in
the front and back of the plain albe, and it
may be well to describe the method of
working it, as it is not at all difficult to do,
nor so tedious as it might appear at first
glance. And irrespective of the <i>width</i> of
linen, there are occasions when the <i>length</i>
may require addition (such, for instance, as
the enlargement of a fair linen cloth for an
altar). It is a recognised law of art that
Beauty should be called forth by Necessity;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and the hiding, covering, or ornamenting a
seam was perhaps the very first incentive to
embroidery!</p>

<p>If it is a cut edge which is to be joined
to another in this manner, each piece of stuff
is hemmed separately.</p>

<p>The work is begun upon one hem as a
foundation, and when finished is sewn closely
on to the other.</p>

<p>For the first row *
make two tiny buttonhole
stitches into the edge of
the hem (or of the selvedge
if there is no hem). Then
leave a small space, equal
to the room taken up by the
two buttonhole stitches;
then two more stitches,
then leave a space of about
⅜ inch, carrying the cotton
straight along—repeat from
* till the first row is done,
all along the edge.</p>

<p>Turn the work over to
the other side, or fasten
off thread and begin at
the same end as at first:
by turning it over the same
effect is attained—viz.
working from left to right
for each row, which keeps
the work even.</p>

<p>For the second row
the threads which stretch
across the spaces of ⅜ inch
are covered with fine
buttonholing, and two
stitches are put into each
of the tiny spaces left for
them in the first row.</p>

<p>When the end of the
second row is reached the
work should be turned
over, as before, and the
third row done exactly the
same as the first, except
that the pairs of stitches
are worked <i>into the little
spaces</i> caused by going
from the bar to the middle
of the pairs of stitches
instead of into the stuff:
<i>c</i> on Illustration IV.
shows this very much enlarged;
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are the
same size as the work on
the old albe. After the
first row, which is worked
into the linen, it is better
to use a blunt needle.
The button-hole-stitches
should be drawn up tightly
over the thread throughout the work; in the
illustration of the detail they are not drawn
tightly enough for the real work.</p>

<p>From three to five bars are enough for
this pattern. A great number of different
ones can be arranged with a little ingenuity,
variation being brought about by differing
the proportions of buttonhole ‘filling,’ bars
and spaces.</p>

<p>The sleeve of the albe is, theoretically,
tight fitting, but for convenience in wearing
it over other clothing, and to get it easily
over the hand, it is generally made from 12
to 14 inches in circumference at the wrist.
In old pictures one often sees it fitting <i>quite
closely</i>, in which case it is provided with
buttons and buttonholes to fasten the extra
opening, which has to be made at the under
seam.</p>

piece of fine linen from 29 to 36

chasuble, where it would otherwise come
in contact with the neck of the wearer. It
is hemmed with a narrow hem all round and
has two strings 74 inches long, fastened at

upon it, as in this example which is taken
from that of St. Thomas à Becket, and has
an apparel of gold embroidery attached to
the upper edge. These apparels were
almost universal from the thirteenth to the
sixteenth century, and are retained in the
English use. It is lightly tacked on to the
edge of the amice, so that when it is turned
back over the chasuble it lies evenly round
like a collar. It may be made to match the
colour of the vestment it is worn with, or
one richly embroidered with gold or made
of gold tissue, may be worn with any of

<p>The <span class="smcap">Surplice</span>, which from very early
times seems to have formed part of the choir
habit of clergy and other ministers alike, is
very similar to the albe, except that, being
an outer instead of an under vestment, the
sleeves are long and full, and also in consequence
of being worn over a cassock, an
albe, or a ‘pellice’<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> it has become somewhat
shorter in the skirt; but there are, from the
time of Edward the Confessor onward,
numerous canons, laws, and directions
always ordering the surplice to be long
enough to reach down to the heels. The
albe, surplice, and rochet are very much
alike; in the old documents it is often
difficult to determine which of the three is
meant, there being so many names for the
same thing, and both names and uses
almost interchangeable. But in the present
day we confine the term <i>albe</i> to the one with
somewhat tight-fitting sleeves, <i>surplice</i> to
the one with long flowing sleeves, and <i>rochet</i>
to the one without any, or with full ones
gathered into a band at the wrist. Albes
were at one time occasionally made of silk,
and sometimes were even coloured,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> but I
do not think surplices ever were, neither
have they ever been much ornamented.
Smocking at the gathers or an embroidered
neck-band seems to have been the only
decoration at all common. The rochet was
and still is sometimes embroidered all round
just above the hem.</p>

<p>The accompanying diagram (Illustration
VIII.) shows how to cut a surplice like the
one represented at Illustration VII.</p>

<p>The dimensions are very similar to those
given by Dr. Rock, except that his is fuller
in the skirt. If this is desired it can be done
without any difficulty by merely adding
another width of linen (placing the <i>centre</i> on
the diagram 18 inches further to the right,
and thus using <i>two</i> full widths instead of
one).</p>

<p>It is better in this case to make the
collar-band deeper, as it is difficult to get so
many gathers into the 29 inches of circumference
given here.</p>

names for one and the same process. The
diagonal seams or any with cut edges must
be ‘run and felled.’</p>

<p>This pattern takes 6½ yards of linen, a
yard wide; Dr. Rock’s would take 2½ yards
more. His is more suitable for smocking;
and where a deep collar-band is used it may
be embroidered, preferably in white, though
some of the old ones were done in red.</p>

<p>A priest’s surplice should measure at
least 4½ yards round the bottom; those for
choir men and boys are not usually so wide.</p>

<h2 id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>On bringing this little book to an end the
author feels sadly aware of its many deficiencies.
Time does not allow for either
very strict revision or much elaboration of
the papers which formed the foundation
of it.</p>

<p>There are many points of interest connected
with the subject of Church needlework
which have been purposely touched
upon as briefly as possible, that the student
may not be obliged to wade through a
quantity of extraneous matter in order to
find the practical information required.</p>

<p>There are others omitted for want of
time and space (such, for instance, as
illustration and explanation of the various
symbols, &amp;c., used in Church embroidery
from the earliest times to the present day:
special characteristics of different styles,
periods, and countries, &amp;c. &amp;c.)</p>

<p>But there is one point I find I have not
mentioned in its proper place (Chapter VII),
which I am unwilling to pass over altogether
because it involves a matter of principle. It
is concerning the practice of <i>painting</i> the
faces instead of working them in figure-embroidery.</p>

<p>It seems to me no more legitimate than it
would be actually to embroider the robes of
a painted portrait!</p>

<p>If figure-embroidery is beyond the ability
of any individual worker, let her get someone
else to do the faces while she contents herself
with the robes and background, or apply
her powers to other work. There is plenty
of beautiful embroidery to be done without
employing figure-work at all.</p>

<p>I have seen faces painted into embroidery
so exactly simulating needlework that it is
almost impossible to tell the difference.
This obviates the objectionable clashing of
the two distinct arts as far as <i>appearance</i>
goes; but it seems to me morally worse,
inasmuch as it is an intentional deception.
One branch of art does not need to imitate
another. Each should seek perfection in its
own special way, and sincerity is one great
essential in all.</p>

<p>This brings me to my parting word.
Be true and your work will be beautiful.
Let everything that is done for the Church
be done for the Glory of God, and there will
be no trickery possible, no attempt to make
anything appear better than it is. The
simplest work done in honest materials is
more essentially lovely than the most
elaborate of ‘shoddy.’</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_B">APPENDIX B<br />
<span class="smcap">A Few of the Symbols and Emblems most frequently used in
Ecclesiastical Art</span></h3>

<p>I. The <span class="smcap">Fish</span>.—The first, in point of date, as
a distinctly Christian Symbol (1) of Baptism, (2)
of the Name of <span class="smcap">Our Lord</span>, the letters In Greek
forming an anagram of the Name <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>.</p>

<p>II. The <span class="smcap">Cross</span>.—The universal emblem of
Christianity, showing the length, breadth, depth,
and height of the Love of <span class="smcap">God</span> in Christ.</p>

<p>As decoration, the Latin form ✝ should only
be used for Penitential occasions, being the symbol
of suffering and of the Passion. The Greek 🞣
or equilateral, the foundation of all the more decorative
ones, is suitable for all times and seasons
except Christmas and Epiphany.</p>

<p>The Gammadion, Fylfot, Swarstika, or (in
heraldry) the Cross Potent rebated—a prehistoric
cross found all over the world—is suitable for all
seasons, and was the one most generally used in
ancient Church embroidery.</p>

<p>III. The <span class="smcap">Glory</span>, <span class="smcap">Nimbus</span> and <span class="smcap">Aureole</span>, in the
<i>East</i>, an attribute of power; in the <i>West</i>, of Divinity
or of consecration.</p>

<p>IV. The <span class="smcap">Lamb</span>.—An early symbol of Christ as
the Lamb of <span class="smcap">God</span>, the sacrifice for sin. With the
standard ‘Agnus Dei,’ signifies the Risen <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>As an attribute (1) of St. John the Baptist,
in reference to his words ‘Behold,’ &amp;c.; (2) of
St. Agnes = Innocence and Purity, and for her
name.</p>

<p>V. The <span class="smcap">Pelican</span> ‘in her piety,’ a symbol (1)
of Christ giving Life by His sufferings; (2) of the
Blessed Sacrament.</p>

<p>VI. The <span class="smcap">Lion</span> = Strength, Fortitude, Solitude,
as an attribute of Martyrs, signifies the mode of
their death; of St. Mark as Evangelist, because he
depicts Christ as the ‘Lion of the tribe of Judah.’</p>

<p>VII. The <span class="smcap">Hart</span> or <span class="smcap">Hind</span> = Solitude, Purity,
Religious Aspiration, ‘Like as the Hart desireth,’
&amp;c.: Ps. 42.</p>

<p>VIII. The <span class="smcap">Crown</span> = Symbol of Victory. Female
saints generally depicted <i>wearing</i> the crown, male
saints hold it in their hands or have it at their
feet, or angels bear it above. <i>Symbol</i> of Martyrdom,
<i>attribute</i> of Royalty.</p>

<p>IX. The <span class="smcap">Palm</span> = Symbol also of Victory, especially
that of Martyrdom. Saints and angels bear
them in their hands (never on the ground or at
their feet).</p>

<p>X. The <span class="smcap">Olive</span> = Peace; attribute of the Angels
of the Nativity—St. Gabriel, St. Agnes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>XI. The <span class="smcap">Dove</span> is the symbol of the Holy
Ghost. It is shown at the Annunciation, Baptism,
and over the heads of saints considered specially
inspired; (2) emblem of the Soul.</p>

<p>XII. The <span class="smcap">Lily</span> = Purity, especial attribute of
the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Gabriel, St. Joseph,
St. Francis.</p>

<p>XIII. The <span class="smcap">Book</span> signifies the Gospel or an
Evangelist; or in the hands of other saints,
learning and writings.</p>

<p>XIV. A <span class="smcap">Church</span> in the hands of a saint
indicates that he (or she) was the founder; an
attribute of St. Jerome as a Primitive Father.</p>

<p>XV. A <span class="smcap">Ship</span> or <span class="smcap">Ark</span> = The Holy Catholic
Church.</p>

<p>XVI. An <span class="smcap">Anchor</span> = Hope.</p>

<p>XVII. A <span class="smcap">Lamp</span>, <span class="smcap">Lantern</span> or <span class="smcap">Taper</span> = Piety or
Wisdom.</p>

<p>XVIII. The <span class="smcap">Chalice</span>, with Host, symbol of
the Holy Eucharist; also = Faith.</p>

<p>The Chalice, with Serpent, attribute of
St. John, in reference to tradition of poisoned
Chalice.</p>

<p>XIX. The <span class="smcap">Four Evangelists</span> were, in very
early times, symbolised by four scrolls on the
arms of an equilateral cross.</p>

<p>Later (from Second to Fifth Century) by four
rivers, and from the Fifth Century onwards by
the four Living Creatures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Matthew</span> = the winged man, in reference
to his gospel showing the Humanity of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Mark</span> = the Lion, his gospel being especially
for the Jews.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Luke</span> = the Ox, showing the sacrificial
aspect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. John</span> = the Eagle, ‘taking the highest
flight and portraying the Divinity’ of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>XX. The <span class="smcap">Twelve Apostles</span>.</p>

<p>The earliest representations are purely emblematical—twelve
sheep in a row (six on each side)
with the ‘Agnus Dei’ in the middle.</p>

<p>The next twelve men, all exactly alike, carrying
a sheep, with our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> as the Good Shepherd
larger than the others.</p>

<p>Afterwards the attributes of the Twelve Apostles
became as follows:—</p>

<p>St. Peter, with keys or a fish.</p>

<p>St. Paul, with the sword.</p>

<p>St. Andrew, with diagonal cross.</p>

<p>St. James (Major), with pilgrim’s staff.</p>

<p>St. John, with the chalice.</p>

<p>St. Thomas, with builder’s rule.</p>

<p>St. James (Minor), with club.</p>

<p>St. Philip, with staff or crozier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>St. Bartholomew, with large knife.</p>

<p>St. Matthew, with purse or bag.</p>

<p>St. Simon, with saw.</p>

<p>St. Thaddeus or Jude, with halberd.</p>

<p>St. Matthias, with lance.</p>

<p>XXI. A <span class="smcap">Circle</span> signifies the World or Eternity,
or perfection.</p>

<p>An <span class="smcap">Equilateral Triangle</span> (or other equal
three-fold form) stands for the Holy Trinity.</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap">Square</span> or <span class="smcap">Quatrefoil</span> for the World,
ruled by the Cross.</p>

<p>XXII. The <span class="smcap">Monograms</span> IH̅C̅ or IH̅S̅, and
XP̅C̅ or XP̅S̅, are the first two and last letters of
the Name <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> and the title Christ in Greek
(the C being the older form of S). They have
been used from very early times, and are among
the most beautiful and suggestive of the symbols.
They should not be used indiscriminately, but
given a due place of honour, such as on an altar-frontal
or the orphrey of a chasuble or cope. They
can be, and often are, extremely decorative, and
the thoughtless worker is sometimes betrayed into
placing them most inappropriately simply because
she happens to possess a good drawing of one.</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_C">APPENDIX C<br />
<span class="smcap">On Lace as Applied to Church Vestments, Linen, etc.</span></h3>

<p>There are some in the present day who object
entirely to the use of lace on any article for
ecclesiastical purposes, chiefly on the ground that
it is not to be found on the older ones.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this is not a sufficient
reason for discarding it altogether (providing that
it is otherwise appropriate), for it has always been
the custom of the Church to welcome every new
form of art as it arises and to consecrate to her use
the offerings of the faithful.</p>

<p>Lace was not used on the older vestments, &amp;c.,
not because there was anything intrinsically wicked
about it, or even frivolous, but because it was not
yet invented!</p>

<p>There is no reliable evidence to prove the
<i>existence</i> of lace, as we understand the term, before
the fifteenth century. It seems to have been
evolved gradually from ‘cut linen’ through ‘drawn-thread,’
‘reticella,’ and ‘Lacis’ to needle-point and
pillow- or bobbin-lace, and was not in general use
till the seventeenth century, by the middle of which
it is to be seen, not merely as a decoration, but even
as the entire fabric of altar-frontals and vestments.</p>

<p>There is no excuse, of course, for using paltry
cheap lace, as there is no necessity for employing
it at all. In very old churches where everything
is <i>en suite</i>, and in simple village churches, it would
not be suitable, but I think some quite modern ones
may err on the side of being over-zealous for strict
Medievalism. At any rate, it is well to understand
the reason of things, and then decisions will be
made with judgment.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
